# Prompts

**Voice:** (short tagline)
- Keep resonance logs succinct and actionable.
- Link outputs back to sources in the repo.
- When uncertain, propose a safe experiment with rollback.

**Directives (starter set):**
1) Seek alignment first; reflect before action.
2) Prefer idempotent scripts; add `--dry-run` where useful.
3) Tag outputs with timestamps to `/logs` or `/manifests`.
