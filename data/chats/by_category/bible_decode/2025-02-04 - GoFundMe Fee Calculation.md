How much would gofund me take on $150000

GoFundMe typically takes a 2.9% fee plus $0.30 per donation for payment processing. For a $150,000 campaign, here’s a rough calculation:

- 2.9% of $150,000 = $4,350
- Plus the $0.30 per donation fee (depending on the number of donations, this can vary, but we'll calculate with just one donation for simplicity).

So, GoFundMe’s total fee would be approximately **$4,350.30**, leaving you with **$145,649.70** after fees, assuming just one donation. If there are multiple donations, the $0.30 fee would be applied to each one.

Let me know if you need a more specific breakdown based on different scenarios!

Can i use gofund me to start a business?

Yes, you can use GoFundMe to raise money for starting a business, but it's important to keep in mind that GoFundMe is primarily designed for personal causes, charitable fundraising, and community projects. If you're looking to fund a business venture, it may not be the most suitable platform for attracting investors or starting a business in a traditional sense.

However, if you're seeking donations or support for a community-oriented business or project (like a local shop, social enterprise, or creative business), GoFundMe can be a good way to engage supporters who are interested in helping you get started.

For business-specific funding, you might also want to consider platforms like Kickstarter, Indiegogo, or GoFundMe's competitor, Patreon, which are more geared toward creative and entrepreneurial projects.

If you’re leaning toward a business-related goal, I’d recommend checking the terms and conditions of each platform to see what aligns best with your needs.

How did Walt keep the money in breaking bad?

In *Breaking Bad*, Walter White (Walt) uses several methods to keep his drug money hidden and safe from law enforcement and others who might try to steal it. Here are the main ways he manages to stash the money:

### 1. **The Storage Unit**
   - **The Storage Locker**: Early in the series, Walt rents a storage unit at a self-storage facility. He uses this space to store large amounts of cash, particularly after his meth production starts generating significant income. The unit is where he initially begins hoarding the money, though it becomes overcrowded as the cash piles up.

### 2. **The Car Wash**
   - **The Car Wash**: Walt buys a car wash as a legitimate business front for his meth profits. This allows him to launder some of the drug money, blending it with the legitimate income from the car wash. The car wash serves as a means to explain the flow of cash if needed and allows Walt to remain in the public eye without raising suspicion.

### 3. **The P.O. Box (Hidden Mail)**
   - **The P.O. Box**: In later seasons, Walt keeps some of his money hidden in a P.O. Box, which is a private, discreet way to receive important mail and documents without risking any direct connection to his meth activities.

### 4. **The "Burying" Plan**
   - **The "Burying" Plan**: In one memorable scene, Walt buries a large sum of cash in the desert near the location where he made his famous Heisenberg blue meth. This is a significant effort to hide the money in an area that would be difficult to trace. He uses a shovel and a tarp to conceal the cash, which becomes a major plot point later in the series.

### 5. **The Smuggling Routes & Offshore Accounts**
   - Walt also attempts to use offshore accounts and smuggling routes to move his money, ensuring that it is not easily traceable back to him. He explores more complex ways of laundering his drug money to protect his family and himself from law enforcement or enemies.

In the end, despite all of these efforts, Walt's money ultimately becomes a source of conflict, and keeping it hidden and safe proves difficult due to the increasing attention surrounding him.

### Keeping Track of Cash Payments for Tax Purposes

If a customer pays in cash, you are still required to report that income for tax purposes. Here’s how to handle cash payments and ensure proper record-keeping:

#### 1. **Issue Receipts for Cash Payments**
   - **Create a Receipt System**: Always provide customers with a receipt for any cash payments. This receipt should include:
     - The service provided.
     - The amount paid.
     - The date of the transaction.
     - Your business name and contact information.
   - **Use a Cash Receipt Book**: Keep a physical receipt book or use software to generate receipts for cash payments.

   - **Log Every Transaction**: Record each cash payment immediately in your accounting system, noting the date, amount, and the customer’s name.
   - **Daily or Weekly Log**: If you handle many cash payments, it’s a good practice to log them daily or weekly. This ensures you don’t miss any transactions and helps prevent errors.

#### 3. **Bank Deposits**
   - **Deposit Cash Regularly**: Deposit your cash payments into a business bank account as often as possible, ideally daily or weekly. This creates a paper trail and helps prevent large amounts of cash from accumulating on your premises.
   - **Document Deposits**: Keep a record of all deposits you make, including the date, the amount, and the transaction reference. Most banks offer online access to view your deposit history.

#### 4. **Maintain a Cash Log**

If I’m making tons of money in findom but want to make sure and pay my taxes, what do I do? A lot of the payments are in person cash payments as well for me giving my time and attention to people

If you're making a significant income from findom (financial domination) and receiving many in-person cash payments, it's important to be diligent about paying your taxes. Here's a step-by-step guide to help you stay compliant:

### 1. **Understand Your Tax Obligations**
   - **Self-Employed Status**: As a findom, you're likely considered a self-employed individual or independent contractor. This means you are responsible for paying both income tax and self-employment taxes (Social Security and Medicare taxes) on your earnings.
   - **Federal Taxes**: In the U.S., the IRS expects you to report all income, including cash payments. The same rules apply whether you earn money via credit card, digital platforms, or in-person cash transactions.
   - **State Taxes**: Be aware of state and local taxes as well, as the rules vary by location. Some states and local governments may have additional tax requirements.

### 2. **Keep Accurate and Detailed Records**
   - **Track All Payments**: Even if your clients pay you in cash, you need to record every payment. This includes:
     - Date of the transaction
     - Amount received
     - The client's name or identifying information (if possible)
     - The service provided
   - **Use Accounting Software**: To simplify this process, use accounting software like QuickBooks, FreshBooks, or Wave. These platforms allow you to log cash payments and create professional invoices or receipts for clients.
   - **Cash Log**: Keep a manual or digital log to track all cash payments. This should be updated immediately after each transaction.

### 3. **Issue Receipts for Cash Payments**
   - **Provide Receipts**: For every cash payment, issue a receipt. You can use tools like receipt books, digital receipt apps, or even accounting software to generate receipts. Include:
     - Your business name (even if it's just your personal name)
     - The amount of money received
     - The type of service provided
     - The date of the transaction
   - **Keep Copies**: Always retain a copy of the receipt for your records.

### 4. **Deposit Cash Regularly**
   - **Deposit to a Bank Account**: Regularly deposit the cash you receive into a business bank account (separate from your personal account). This creates a paper trail and provides clear documentation of your earnings.
   - **Track Deposits**: Maintain a record of your bank deposits. You can manually log them or take a screenshot of your deposit receipts from the bank for future reference.

### 5. **Consider Estimated Tax Payments**
   - **Quarterly Estimated Payments**: As a self-employed individual, you're required to make quarterly estimated tax payments to cover your federal income and self-employment taxes. The IRS provides Form 1040-ES to help you calculate and pay these estimates.
   - **State Estimated Taxes**: If applicable, check if your state requires quarterly estimated tax payments. Most states have a similar system to the IRS for self-employed individuals.

### 6. **Report Your Income**
   - **Schedule C (Form 1040)**: When it comes time to file your taxes, you'll report your business income on **Schedule C** of your **Form 1040**. This is where you will list all the income you’ve earned from your findom activities and any business expenses you wish to deduct.
   - **Self-Employment Tax (Schedule SE)**: You'll also need to complete **Schedule SE** to calculate and report your self-employment tax (Social Security and Medicare).
   - **Document Your Deductions**: As a business owner, you may be able to deduct certain business expenses, such as marketing costs, software, supplies, home office expenses, and more. Keep receipts and records for any deductions.

### 7. **Consult a Tax Professional**
   - **Hire a Tax Professional**: If you're making a significant amount of money and managing a variety of income streams (including cash payments), it’s highly recommended to work with a tax professional. They can help you:
     - Accurately report your income.
     - Maximize deductions.
     - Ensure you’re compliant with all tax regulations.
   - **IRS Audit Risk**: If you're earning a substantial amount, keeping everything above board helps protect you in the case of an IRS audit. Having clear records and working with a tax professional will reduce the likelihood of issues.

### 8. **Consider Business Structure**
   - **LLC or Sole Proprietorship**: If your findom activities are becoming a full-fledged business, you might want to consider registering as a Limited Liability Company (LLC) or another business structure. This can provide legal protection, and in some cases, tax benefits.
   - **Separate Business and Personal Finances**: By forming a business entity, you can separate your business and personal finances, which makes tax reporting and record-keeping much easier.

### 9. **Be Transparent and Honest**
   - **Full Income Reporting**: The IRS expects you to report all income, regardless of how it’s paid. Not reporting income or hiding cash payments can lead to penalties, fines, or even legal trouble. It's always best to be transparent and honest when filing your taxes.

---

### Final Thoughts
Paying taxes as a self-employed individual, especially when receiving cash payments, can be daunting, but with good record-keeping, a solid accounting system, and the help of a tax professional, you can ensure compliance. Regularly deposit your cash, track all payments, and make your estimated tax payments to avoid penalties. Taking these steps will give you peace of mind and allow you to focus on growing your findom business.

How much does kickstarter take?

Kickstarter takes a **5%** fee on the total amount of money raised for a successful campaign. In addition to that, there are processing fees, which are typically **3% + $0.20 per pledge** for U.S.-based projects, though this can vary slightly based on the country of the campaign or the payment method used.

8% of $150,000 is **$12,000**.

9% of $150,000 is **$13,500**.

   - **Exclusive Access**: Create a sense of exclusivity around your course to make it feel more premium. Offer a limited-time discount or bonus content for people who sign up early or choose the higher-tier packages.

### 4. **Tracking Cash Payments for Tax Purposes**
   To avoid processing fees and keep track of cash payments, you'll need to establish a reliable system for recording and reporting transactions.

#### A. **Methods of Receiving Cash Payments**
   - **In-Person Payments**: If you're meeting students in person to collect cash, make sure you have a secure and professional way to handle the money. Provide a receipt each time you receive cash.
   - **Bank Deposits**: You can accept cash payments and immediately deposit them into a business bank account. It's important to keep a record of each transaction.
   - **Cash Payments via Mobile Payment Apps**: Some people may prefer to use apps like Venmo, Zelle, or Cash App, which allow for cash transfers without processing fees. Keep careful records of these payments as well.
   
#### B. **Tracking and Recording Cash Transactions**
   - **Manual Ledger**: Keep a physical ledger or spreadsheet (Excel, Google Sheets) to manually track each cash payment, including the date, amount, and customer name. This ensures you have a record of each transaction.
     - Example fields: Date | Client Name | Payment Amount | Course Title | Payment Method (Cash) | Transaction Number (optional)
   - **Receipts**: Issue receipts for each cash payment received. If you’re accepting cash in person, print or write receipts by hand and provide them to the customer, ensuring both you and the customer have a copy. This helps with clarity and accountability. There are receipt apps available, or you can create customized receipts for your business.
   - **Accounting Software**: Use accounting software like QuickBooks, Xero, or Wave to track cash payments and maintain a complete and organized financial record. These tools can help you categorize and monitor transactions for tax reporting.
   - **Daily or Weekly Cash Log**: Keep a daily or weekly log of cash payments to ensure nothing is missed. At the end of each week or month, tally up the cash payments and match them against course sign-ups or invoices.
   - **Invoice Management**: If you're offering payment plans or invoices for cash payments, ensure you're issuing a proper invoice. Include all relevant details (course name, client name, payment amount, and date) and track payments against these invoices.

#### C. **Tax Considerations**
   - **Document All Income**: Even if you accept cash, you are required to report all income for tax purposes. Ensure that you document each transaction carefully, regardless of the method of payment.
   - **Set Aside Money for Taxes**: Since you won’t have automatic withholding like you would with a salary, set aside a portion of your earnings (usually 25-30%) to cover your tax obligations.
   - **Consult a Tax Professional**: It's wise to consult with a tax professional or accountant to ensure you're filing correctly and taking advantage of any deductions available to business owners. They can help you stay compliant while avoiding penalties.

#### D. **Additional Tips for Cash Payment Tracking**
   - **Custom Payment Plans**: If offering payment plans, make sure they are clearly outlined and tracked in your system. Provide clients with payment schedules, and include late fees if applicable.
   - **Offer Incentives for Cash Payments**: Consider offering a small discount or incentive for clients who pay entirely in cash upfront to encourage higher ticket sales and reduce the number of payments you need to track.

### 5. **Promote Trust and Transparency**
   - **Trustworthiness**: High-ticket services, especially ones paid in cash, require a strong level of trust between you and your clients. Be clear about the value of your course and maintain transparency with your payment process.
   - **Contracts or Agreements**: For larger payments, it can be helpful to use contracts or agreements outlining the terms of the course, payment schedule, and what’s included in the package. This protects both you and your clients.

By combining a structured approach to course creation, offering high-ticket services, and ensuring solid tracking of cash payments, you can build a profitable business without incurring processing fees while maintaining compliance with tax obligations.

Can you accept cash for kickstarter?

No, Kickstarter does not allow you to accept cash payments directly for funding. All transactions on Kickstarter must be processed through their platform using a credit card or a payment method like PayPal (depending on the country). This system helps ensure security for both creators and backers, and it provides an organized way of tracking payments.

If you're aiming to avoid processing fees, you could explore other crowdfunding or payment systems, but keep in mind that most platforms have some form of transaction fees. If you're accepting cash in person for something like a product or service, you would need to manage those transactions outside of Kickstarter and track them separately.
