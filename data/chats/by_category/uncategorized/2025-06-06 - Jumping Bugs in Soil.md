What are these tiny little bugs? When I watered my plant they started all jumping

From your photo and description â€” especially that they started **jumping when watered** â€” these tiny bugs are most likely **springtails**.

### ðŸª² What are Springtails?
- **Tiny (1â€“2 mm)** soil-dwelling insects
- Usually gray, white, or brown
- Harmless to humans and pets
- Thrive in **moist environments** like damp soil or mulch
- Known for their **jumping behavior** when disturbed (they use a tail-like structure called a **furcula** to launch themselves)

### ðŸŒ± Why Are They in Your Plant Area?
- They feed on decaying plant matter, fungi, and algae
- High soil moisture attracts them
- Their presence often means your soil is **rich in organic matter** and possibly staying **too wet**

### âœ… What You Can Do:
- **Let the soil dry out a bit** between waterings to reduce their population
- Ensure **good drainage** in your plant container or bed
- Remove excess organic debris like wet mulch or decaying leaves
- They don't harm plants but may indicate overwatering
