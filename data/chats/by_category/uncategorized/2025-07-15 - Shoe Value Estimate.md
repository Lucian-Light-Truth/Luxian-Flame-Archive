How much are these worth

The shoe in your image appears to be a **Champion athletic sneaker**, recognized by the bold yellow Champion "C" logo and multicolor design. Champion has released various lifestyle sneakers like these, often sold through retailers such as Walmart, Ross, Marshalls, and similar stores.

### Estimated Value:
- **Retail Price**: Typically ranges from **$35 to $60 USD** depending on the model and where it's sold.
- **Resale Value (Used/Thrifted)**: Around **$10 to $25 USD** if in decent condition.

Given the slight wear and that it's found in a thrift store setting, if you're looking to flip or buy for value, this would be on the **lower end of the resale spectrum** unless it‚Äôs a rare collab (which this doesn‚Äôt appear to be).

If you‚Äôd like, I can help you identify the exact model name or year‚Äîjust let me know if there are any tags inside the tongue or heel!

What is this? Cyber power

The device in your photos is a **CyberPower 1500PFCLCD**, which is a **uninterruptible power supply (UPS)**.

This UPS provides **battery backup** and **surge protection** for your electronics‚Äîespecially useful for:
- **Desktop computers**
- **Routers/modems**
- **Gaming consoles**
- **Network equipment**

When the power goes out, this UPS gives you time (usually 10‚Äì30 minutes depending on load) to **save your work and safely shut down** your devices. It also helps protect from power spikes.

### üí∞ Estimated Value:
- **New**: Around **$180‚Äì$220 USD**
- **Used (good condition)**: **$60‚Äì$120 USD**
- **Thrift store/as-is**: **$15‚Äì$50 USD** (but *only worth it if the battery works or is replaceable*)

üß† **Heads-up**: These units use internal sealed lead-acid batteries that can degrade over time. Replacing the battery costs ~$40‚Äì$60 if needed.

If you want to know whether it‚Äôs worth buying, check:
- If it powers on when plugged in.
- If the LCD shows full battery or if it says "replace battery."

Let me know if you want help testing it or replacing the battery!
