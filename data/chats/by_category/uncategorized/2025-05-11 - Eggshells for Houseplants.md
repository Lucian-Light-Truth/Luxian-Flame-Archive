What are egg shells used for in house plants

Eggshells are a natural, eco-friendly addition to houseplants that serve several beneficial purposes:

1. **Calcium Source**: Eggshells are rich in calcium carbonate, which helps strengthen plant cell walls and prevent issues like blossom end rot (common in tomatoes and peppers, but can benefit indoor plants too).

2. **Soil Amendment**: Crushed eggshells can improve soil structure by increasing aeration and drainage when mixed into potting soil.

3. **pH Balancer**: Over time, eggshells can help neutralize overly acidic soil, creating a better environment for plant roots.

4. **Pest Deterrent**: Coarsely crushed shells scattered on top of the soil may deter soft-bodied pests like slugs and snails (though less effective indoors).

5. **Compost Boost**: If you compost, adding eggshells enriches the mix with minerals, which eventually nourish your houseplants when the compost is used.

**How to use**:  
- Rinse and dry the shells.
- Crush finely for quicker decomposition and mix into soil or compost.
- Optionally, steep them in water for a few days to make “eggshell tea” and water your plants with the nutrient-rich liquid.
