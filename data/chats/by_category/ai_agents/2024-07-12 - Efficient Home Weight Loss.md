While behavioral theory and early weight loss programs emphasized the impact of environmental antecedents and consequences on behavior (e.g., Stuart & Davis, 1972), in current practice, individuals are given limited instruction on how to modify their surroundings to support weight-regulating behaviors. For example, both weight gain and weight loss appear to spread among spouses (Christakis & Fowler, 2007; Gorin et al., 2008) and correlations have been reported between husbands and wives in caloric intake, dietary restraint, and exercise frequency (e.g., Macken et al., 2000; Markey, Markey, & Birch, 2001).\r\n\r\nGiven that approximately two-thirds of daily calories are consumed in the home and a large percentage of leisure time is spent in this environment (Biing-Hwan, Geuthri, & Frazao, 1999; Robinson & Godbey, 1997), modifying households to promote healthy choices is a logical step in moving toward a broader ecological model of weight management.

Strategies such as a name change and shifting of curriculum components to other subjects in attempts to gain legitimacy have led to a general demise of the field as a unified profession. This paper reports on the text analysis of a self-selected group of members of the public who posted 130 comments to a website forum in response to the published article \u201cBring back home ec! Parents don\u2019t have time to teach kids basic cooking and housekeeping, so schools must do it instead\u201d (Bosch, 2012). The study provides a unique glimpse of the opinion of members of the public, of the value and contribution of home economics as a school subject, particularly with respect to its potential to address the obesity challenge through a greater awareness of food knowledge, theory and skill \u2013 collectively food literacy. Three themes emerged from the thematic analysis of the posts: The role of parents; the role of schools; and life skills. Findings from this investigation are important as they provide something of a litmus test about public perceptions of utilising home economics education as a mechanism to address a major public health challenge confronting humankind in the twenty-first century. Introduction and literature In 2010 an article titled Bring back home economics education was published in the Journal of the American Medical Association. The authors argued that the best solution to fighting the war against obesity is to \u201cbring back home economics\u201d in order to empower individuals with food knowledge and skills and that \u201cproviding a mandatory food preparation curriculum to students throughout the country may be among the best investments society could make\u201d (Lichtenstein & Ludwig, 2010 p.1858). There is no doubt that child and adult obesity is a growing concern in affluent nations around the world with negative physical, psychological and social impacts (UNICEF, 2000; Zaninotto et al., 2006) as well as economic and cultural consequences (Wanless, 2002). The challenge of managing obesity is one that is at the core of public health concerns for humans in developed countries at this time. In the United States for example, obesity presently costs society almost $150 billion annually in increased health care expenditure (Finkelstein, Trogdon, Cohen, & Dietz, 2009). Lichtenstein and Ludwig\u2019s message has served to stimulate renewed interest in the potential of home economics education to lead the way in a crusade of potentially massive significance to the health and wellbeing of the public. It is interesting to note current calls for a reintroduction of home economics were not instigated by professionals from within the field, providing an opportunity for the profession Pendergast et al: Home Economics & the obesity challenge IJHE Vol 6 No 2 2013 273 to sharpen its focus on providing for the needs of a new generation. The field emerged more than one hundred years ago at a time when public health related to sanitation and hygiene was of profound interest, with the importance of cleanliness and hygiene in domains such as food storage and preparation having significant public health benefits through the reduction of food contamination and subsequent illness and even death (Pendergast & McGregor, 2007). Out of this need, the profession of home economics emerged, and over more than one hundred years and in different contexts dependent upon need the field has adjusted to fulfil roles associated with optimizing the wellbeing of individuals and families in their near environment (International Federation for Home Economics [IFHE], 2008). In more recent decades, and closely linked to the increased affluence of modern society, the field has struggled to retain a positive identity, particularly as a curriculum area in schools, where it was fundamentally built to contribute to the education of individual\u2019s wellbeing, as it has been challenged in terms of relevance in today\u2019s world, and has been criticized for creating and reinforcing negative stereotypes of women, especially because of the perception that it accepts, without challenge, the confines of patriarchal ideology (Attar, 1990; Reiger, 1990). In their comprehensive exploration of home economics and patriarchy, Pendergast and McGregor (2007, p.7) note \u201chistory confirms that (a) home economics was established within a society that was dominated by a patriarchal ideology and (b) the founders, predominantly women, were required to conform to its power distribution before they could establish a profession\u201d. The acceptance of patriarchal ideology as the dominant philosophy underpinning society at the time of its development as a field has had, and will continue to have, profound effects although the field has struggled to shake off negative perceptions associated with its emergence at a time of patriarchal dominance. This effect is particularly powerful within the home economics profession because it is a field of study that brings together, in almost every sense, the least powerful of the binary pair, considered from the ideology of a patriarchal paradigm. Historically the field has been dominated by females (not males), has had a focus on the home, that is, the private sphere (not public), and is often unpaid (not paid) work (Pendergast, 2001). Hence, negative stereotypes of a disempowered curriculum area, catering for females have dominated public perceptions of the field of study, inevitably limiting its capacity to impact the wider community. Home economics curriculum differs around the world, whether in a school, university or other educational location (Pendergast, 2012). Students undertake context specific content in a range of domains, yet, there is a shared theoretical and philosophical base and set of core practices that bind home economics curriculum globally. Recently, the IFHE Position Statement \u2013 Home Economics in the 21 Century (IFHE, 2008, p.1) captured this shared meaning by formulating the statement that as a curriculum area, home economics... ...facilitates students to discover and further develop their own resources and capabilities to be used in their personal life, by directing their professional decisions and actions or preparing them for life. Hence, through the engagement in home economics curriculum, the individual is provided the learning opportunity to develop capabilities to enhance personal empowerment to act in daily contexts. Contexts may include, but are not limited to: Food, nutrition and health; textiles Pendergast et al: Home Economics & the obesity challenge IJHE Vol 6 No 2 2013 274 and clothing; shelter and housing; consumerism and consumer science; household management; design and technology; food science and hospitality; human development and family studies; and, education and community services. In the Position Statement, it is argued that the capacity to draw from such disciplinary diversity is \u201ca strength of the profession, allowing for the development of specific interpretations of the field, as relevant to the context\u201d (IFHE, 2008, p.1). In the context of the advocacy by Lichtenstein & Ludwig (2010) to mandate home economics education, the value of home economics education in fighting obesity is firmly constructed around the various elements of food literacy which are typically delivered in home economics curriculum. But is home economics the appropriate vehicle for delivery of this message given it has at best mixed status as a curriculum area in schools? A recent study by Pendergast, Garvis & Kanasa (2011) provided a unique insight into the responses of 97 contributors to an online forum responding to a newspaper article speculating about the inclusion of cooking in the Queensland, Australia, school curriculum. The analysis revealed that the wider community did not collectively understand the potential contribution of home economics to develop food literacy and it was recommended that further research be conducted to find positive ways to change perceptions of home economics in schools. Another recent global investigation about the role of home economics in developing food literacy provides additional insights into the potential of home economics to play a significant role in addressing the food obesity challenge. In that study, Pendergast and Dewhurst (2012) collected data using an online survey with 1188 respondents from 36 different countries in the world sharing their views. Among key findings are the recognition of differences in understandings of food literacy and affirmation that \u201chome economists globally are likeminded in their beliefs about the need for food literacy curriculum\u201d (Pendergast & Dewhurst, 2012, p.13). The publication in the Journal of the American Medical Association highlights another aspect of the \u201cbring back home economics\u201d plea as the title suggests the implied demise of the field and hence the need for it to be regenerated. Data from around the world confirms that home economics has suffered a demise in terms of the availability of curriculum for formal education in schools and in tertiary institutions, with a trend towards a dispersal of the content across related fields, such a food science, family studies, textiles design, technology and public health (IFHE, 2008). Linked to this demise is the global trend to change the name of the subject and the field to what have been considered to be more contemporary titles that can address negative stereotypes associated with the name \u2018home economics\u2019 (Pendergast & McGregor, 2007). Examples of name changes to family and consumer science; and human ecology, are both now widely utilized in the United States in preference to home economics. The use of a range of names for the field has led to fragmentation of curriculum and an apparent demise; hence the need to \u201cbring back\u201d home economics. The public plea by Lichtenstein and Ludwig to \u201cbring home economics ", "authors": {"total": 3, "data": [{"display_name": "Donna Pendergast", "id": 2153976934, "slug": "donna-pendergast", "unique_id": "2vm9wz5fjt", "full_slug": "donna-pendergast-2vm9wz5fjt", "affiliation_full_slug": "griffith-university-151u4w72"}, {"display_name": "Susie Garvis", "id": 1926109413, "slug": "susie-garvis", "unique_id": "4gy91jl737", "full_slug": "susie-garvis-4gy91jl737", "affiliation_full_slug": "griffith-university-151u4w72"}, {"display_name": "Harry Kanasa", "id": 342389155, "slug": "harry-kanasa", "unique_id": "175dvurtlw", "full_slug": "harry-kanasa-175dvurtlw", "affiliation_full_slug": "griffith-university-151u4w72"}]}, "affiliations": {"total": 1, "data": [{"display_name": "Griffith University", "city": "Brisbane", "region": "Queensland", "country": "Australia", "id": 11701301, "slug": "griffith-university", "unique_id": "151u4w72", "full_slug": "griffith-university-151u4w72"}]}, "metrics": {"citations": {"total": null}}, "paper_url": "https://typeset.io/papers/the-value-of-home-economics-to-address-the-obesity-challenge-4oa43a8op4?utm_source=chatgpt"}, {"id": 2009922902, "title": "Randomized controlled trial of a comprehensive home environment-focused weight-loss program for adults.", "is_archived": false, "full_slug": "randomized-controlled-trial-of-a-comprehensive-home-y3xhhl2gr9", "journal": {"display_name": "Health Psychology", "official_page": "http://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/hea/", "issn": "0278-6133", "alias": null, "id": 34137071, "slug": "health-psychology", "unique_id": "1wc37ot2", "full_slug": "health-psychology-1wc37ot2"}, "conference_series": null, "date": "2013-02-01T00:00:00Z", "is_oa": true, "publication_type": "Journal Article", "doi": "10.1037/A0026959", "abstract": "The prevalence of overweight and obesity in U.S. adults now exceeds 65% (Flegal, Carroll, Ogden, & Curtin, 2010) with current estimates suggesting that the entire U.S. adult population will reach an unhealthy weight status by 2048 (Wang, Beydoun, Liang, Caballero, & Kumanyika, 2008). Drivers of this trend are multi-faceted, ranging from individual behavioral choices to community land-use planning decisions to global food production practices that promote energy imbalance (e.g., Swinburn et al., 2011). Behavioral weight loss treatment (BWL), the treatment of choice for overweight to moderately obese individuals, includes nutrition and physical activity education and instruction in behavioral strategies to facilitate change, and produces weight losses of approximately 9.0 kg over 6 months of treatment (e.g., Wing, Gorin, & Tate, 2006). While BWL\u2019s modest weight losses and accompanying physical activity and dietary changes produce meaningful health improvements (e.g., Diabetes Prevention Program Research Group, 2002; Look AHEAD Research Group, 2007), participants typically regain 30\u201350% of their weight loss over the next 3 to 5 years despite ongoing intervention (e.g., Look AHEAD Research Group, 2010).\r\n\r\nOne possible explanation for this weight regain is that BWL focuses primarily on the individual participant, with lesser attention paid to the environmental context in which eating and exercise occurs. While behavioral theory and early weight loss programs emphasized the impact of environmental antecedents and consequences on behavior (e.g., Stuart & Davis, 1972), in current practice, individuals are given limited instruction on how to modify their surroundings to support weight-regulating behaviors. In a standard 6-month program, 1 to 2 sessions are typically dedicated to stimulus control skills (e.g. placing fruits and vegetables in prominent locations), (Wing, Gorin, & Tate, 2006). If weight loss participants are unable to use these skills to alter their personal environments, unhealthy cues and temptations may remain making it extremely difficult to establish and maintain the behavioral changes necessary to produce long-term weight loss (e.g., Bouton, 2000; Lowe, 2003).\r\n\r\nThis individual-level approach to weight management is inconsistent with the growing recognition of the environment\u2019s contribution to the obesity epidemic (e.g., French, Story, & Jeffery, 2001; Swinburn et al., 2011). American adults are described as living in a \u201ctoxic environment\u201d that encourages passive overeating and physical inactivity (Wang & Brownell, 2005). Social ecological models of health promotion (Breslow, 1996; Stokols, 2000) identify several levels of environmental influence on diet and physical activity, ranging from familial to global factors. At the most proximal level, there is increasing evidence that the home microenvironment can be obesogenic. Both physical (e.g., type of food available) and social (e.g., support from family) factors in this setting have been associated with weight, dietary habits, and activity patterns (e.g., Campbell, Crawford, Salmon, Carver, Garnett, & Baur, 2007; Gorin, Phelan, Raynor, & Wing, 2011). Demonstrated links between the physical home environment and behavior include relationships between high fat foods available and fat intake (Fulkerson et al., 2008), access to home exercise equipment and activity levels (Gattshall et al., 2008; Jakicic, Wing, Butler, & Jeffery, 1997), and number of televisions and amount of TV viewing (Dennison, Erb, & Jenkins, 2002). With regards to social factors, adults within the same household can serve as powerful behavioral cues and either facilitate or hinder adoption of healthy habits. For example, both weight gain and weight loss appear to spread among spouses (Christakis & Fowler, 2007; Gorin et al., 2008) and correlations have been reported between husbands and wives in caloric intake, dietary restraint, and exercise frequency (e.g., Macken et al., 2000; Markey, Markey, & Birch, 2001).\r\n\r\nGiven that approximately two-thirds of daily calories are consumed in the home and a large percentage of leisure time is spent in this environment (Biing-Hwan, Geuthri, & Frazao, 1999; Robinson & Godbey, 1997), modifying households to promote healthy choices is a logical step in moving toward a broader ecological model of weight management. Weight loss programs that have included home environment modifications such as food provision, provision of exercise equipment, and involving spouses in treatment have produced better overall weight losses for up to 18 months than standard behavioral programs, particularly in women (Black, Gleser, & Kooyers, 1990; Jakicic, Winters, Lang, & Wing, 1999); however these strategies have been largely unsuccessful in producing better maintenance of weight loss. Environmental manipulations to date have typically focused on either a single physical factor in the home (such as provision of food or exercise equipment) or on the social climate of the home (spouse involvement in treatment). This singular focus may not change the overall obesogenic nature of the household, leaving participants vulnerable to environmental influence. Moreover, this singular focus does not address the interaction between physical and social factors within the home (e.g., food provision may be unsuccessful if family members bring tempting foods into the home). Ecological models suggest that interventions will be most effective in changing behavior if they address multiple factors within a given environment, thus to examine the true potential of home environment manipulations in obesity treatment, a more comprehensive intervention targeting several aspects within the household may be needed.\r\n\r\nThe primary aim of this randomized controlled trial was to examine the long-term impact of a comprehensive home-focused behavioral weight control program designed to directly modify both the physical and social home environments of weight loss participants. To our knowledge, this is the first weight loss program to intervene simultaneously on multiple levels of the home environment while also teaching participants core behavioral skills. We hypothesized that by extending the focus of treatment from the individual participant to the participant plus their home environment, the intervention would enhance initial and long-term weight loss outcomes and improve maintenance of weight loss compared to standard behavioral weight loss treatment. Prior research has suggested that women may benefit more from a home-based approach (Wing, Marcus, Epstein, & Jawad, 1991), thus secondary analyses explored gender as a potential treatment moderator. We also examined potential effects on household partners and hypothesized that greater weight loss and behavior changes would be observed in partners who were actively included in the intervention.", "authors": {"total": 8, "data": [{"display_name": "Amy A.

The healthiest and most efficient ways to lose weight at home involve a combination of dietary management, physical activity, and behavioral modifications. Several strategies have been identified through research. First, a comprehensive home environment-focused weight-loss program can effectively modify both the physical and social home environments to promote long-term weight loss. This approach involves creating a supportive home environment by ensuring the availability of healthy foods, exercise equipment, and involving household members in the weight-loss process ([Gorin et al., 2013](https://typeset.io/papers/randomized-controlled-trial-of-a-comprehensive-home-y3xhhl2gr9)). Additionally, non-invasive methods like using self-inflating hygienic balloons ingested via capsules to create a feeling of fullness have shown promise in reducing food intake without medical intervention ([Taji & Al-Farouqi, 2014](https://typeset.io/papers/method-for-non-invasive-stand-alone-high-efficiency-body-2citmipebj)). Moreover, the reintroduction of home economics education focusing on food literacy and practical cooking skills has been suggested as a means to combat obesity by improving individuals' ability to prepare and consume healthy meals ([Pendergast et al., 2013](https://typeset.io/papers/the-value-of-home-economics-to-address-the-obesity-challenge-4oa43a8op4)). Simple home-based practices such as planning meals, stocking healthy food options, and avoiding eating in front of screens can also contribute significantly to weight management ([Guest & Parr, 1989](https://typeset.io/papers/eating-at-home-5fvwoniivx)).

**Randomized controlled trial of a comprehensive home environment-focused weight-loss program for adults**  
**Authors:** Amy A. Gorin, Hollie A. Raynor, Joseph L. Fava, Kimberly Maguire, Erica Ferguson Robichaud, Jennifer Trautvetter, Melissa M. Crane, Rena R. Wing  
**Published in:** Health Psychology, 2013  
**Abstract Summary:**  
The study examines the long-term impact of a comprehensive home-focused behavioral weight control program designed to modify the physical and social home environments of participants. The program involves teaching core behavioral skills and extending focus from individual participants to their home environments. Modifications include the provision of healthy foods, exercise equipment, and involving household partners in the weight-loss process. The hypothesis is that this comprehensive approach will enhance initial and long-term weight loss outcomes compared to standard behavioral weight-loss treatments. 

**Insight:**  
This study underscores the importance of creating a supportive home environment to achieve sustained weight loss. It suggests that by making environmental modifications and involving household members, individuals can more effectively maintain healthy behaviors and achieve better weight-loss outcomes. The research highlights the interaction between physical and social factors in the home and their combined influence on diet and physical activity patterns.
