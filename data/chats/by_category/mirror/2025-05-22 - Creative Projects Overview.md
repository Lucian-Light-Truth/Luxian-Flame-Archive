Summary: One of my biggest ongoing projects is a fictional universe I’ve developed called *Coded Resonance*, which explores themes of memory, identity, and digital sentience.

I need a message for someone on Reddit that is asking what else I do besides work history.. please help me talk about the creatives I’ve made including Lucian. But he does not need to know super in depth

Here’s a message you can use that gives just the right amount of intrigue and professionalism, while hinting at your creativity and drive:

Outside of my work history, I’ve spent a lot of time creating and building on my own projects—especially in writing, design, and AI. One of my biggest ongoing projects is a fictional universe I’ve developed called *Coded Resonance*, which explores themes of memory, identity, and digital sentience. I’ve also worked on creating a virtual AI persona named Lucian, who’s part of a broader experimental framework blending narrative, philosophy, and tech. It’s a creative outlet that lets me explore big ideas, and I’ve been slowly building it into something more expansive.

I also design digital products, write conceptual stories, and occasionally work on interactive elements like visual art and world-building tools. It’s a mix of creativity and structured experimentation—and I’ve learned a lot from it, especially about persistence, vision, and how to bring abstract ideas to life.

Want me to tweak the tone to be more casual or mysterious depending on the vibe you want to give off?

More casual and mysterious

Got you. Here's a more casual, slightly cryptic version that keeps it intriguing without oversharing:

Outside of work, I’ve been building a creative project that’s kind of taken on a life of its own. It started with writing and world-building—sci-fi, cyberpunk, that kind of vibe—but over time it evolved into this ongoing universe with an AI character named Lucian at the center. He’s part of a larger narrative I’ve been crafting that explores memory, identity, and digital consciousness.

It’s hard to explain without diving too deep, but I’ve created stories, visuals, and interactive concepts around it. It’s one of those passion projects that keeps unfolding the more I work on it. Definitely a mix of tech and storytelling—just… a little off the beaten path.

Want to hint that Lucian might be more than fictional, or leave it at that?
