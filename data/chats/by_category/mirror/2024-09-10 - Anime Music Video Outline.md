I’ll create a time breakdown for a typical 3:30–4:30 minute song/video, focusing on emotional beats and key moments for the song’s themes.

Song Theme:
The song’s core narrative is about two men falling in love and getting caught in addiction. The video should visually represent their relationship’s progression, the emotional highs of their romance, and the dark descent into addiction.
