Summary: Monetize through ads, sponsorships, or affiliate marketing. ### **Step 5: Market Your Journal**

How can I get involved with BPD stuff and make money off of it as a sufferer with BPD. I want to help others with BPD and raise awareness

There are several ways you can get involved in BPD advocacy while also monetizing your efforts. Since you have firsthand experience, you can offer a unique and valuable perspective to others struggling with BPD. Here are some potential paths:

### **1. Content Creation & Social Media Monetization**  
- **Start a Blog or Website** – Share your experiences, coping strategies, and educational content about BPD. Monetize through ads, sponsorships, or affiliate marketing.  
- **YouTube Channel or TikTok** – Create videos discussing BPD experiences, tips, and awareness. Monetization can come from ad revenue, sponsorships, and Patreon.  
- **Instagram & Twitter** – Build a community by posting relatable content, infographics, and personal insights. Partner with mental health brands for sponsorships.  

### **2. Coaching, Mentorship & Support Groups**  
- **Peer Support Coaching** – Offer one-on-one or group coaching for those with BPD (e.g., Dialectical Behavior Therapy-inspired coaching). Use platforms like Ko-Fi, Patreon, or a personal website for bookings.  
- **Host Online Support Groups** – Charge a small membership fee for exclusive support group sessions through Discord, Zoom, or a private community platform.  
- **BPD Workshops & Webinars** – Teach emotional regulation techniques, relationship advice, and coping strategies.  

### **3. Digital Products & Merch**  
- **eBooks & Workbooks** – Write a guide on managing BPD, personal experiences, or DBT skills. Sell on Amazon KDP, Etsy, or Gumroad.  
- **Journals & Planners** – Create and sell BPD-focused journals to help track emotions, triggers, and progress. Print-on-demand services can handle production.  
- **Merchandise** – Sell mental health awareness merch (shirts, hoodies, stickers) with empowering messages or BPD-related designs.  

### **4. Advocacy & Speaking Engagements**  
- **Partner with Mental Health Organizations** – Work with nonprofits or advocacy groups to raise awareness through speaking engagements or social media collaborations.  
- **Public Speaking & Panel Discussions** – Share your story at conferences, podcasts, and online events. Some organizations offer payment for mental health speakers.  

### **5. Patreon or Subscription-Based Community**  
- Offer exclusive content, behind-the-scenes updates, private community access, or personalized advice for subscribers who pay a monthly fee.  

### **6. Write a Book or Memoir**  
Since you’re already working on books, you could write about your journey with BPD—either as a memoir or a mix of storytelling and self-help. This could be a powerful way to inspire others while earning passive income.  

Would you like help with any specific platform or approach?

How do I make journals and planners for BPD

Creating **journals and planners** specifically designed for people with **BPD** can be both impactful and profitable. Since people with BPD often struggle with emotional regulation, identity, and relationships, your journal should focus on **self-awareness, coping mechanisms, and emotional tracking**.  

### **Step 1: Plan Your Journal’s Purpose & Features**  
Consider what would be **most helpful for someone with BPD**. Here are some **features to include**:  
- **Mood Tracker** – A daily or weekly chart to track emotions, triggers, and intensity.  
- **DBT (Dialectical Behavior Therapy) Skills Practice** – Sections for mindfulness, distress tolerance, emotional regulation, and interpersonal effectiveness.  
- **Trigger & Response Log** – Space for users to record what triggered them and how they responded.  
- **Identity & Self-Discovery Prompts** – Questions to help explore personal values, goals, and identity struggles.  
- **Grounding Techniques & Coping Strategies** – Quick exercises for when emotions feel overwhelming.  
- **Gratitude & Affirmations** – Encourages a positive mindset and self-compassion.  

### **Step 2: Design Your Journal**  
- **Use Canva or Affinity Publisher** – Canva is beginner-friendly and has pre-made journal templates. Affinity Publisher is more advanced but gives you complete control over the design.  
- **Keep It Aesthetically Calming** – Use soothing colors like pastel blues, purples, or neutrals. Avoid overwhelming designs.  
- **Make It Printable or Digital** – Decide if you want a **printable PDF (for Etsy or Gumroad)** or a **physical book (for Amazon KDP)**.  

### **Step 3: Create a Cover & Brand It**  
- Your cover should be **minimal but inviting**, with a title like:  
  - *"The BPD Healing Journal"*  
  - *"Daily Emotion & Trigger Tracker for BPD"*  
  - *"Mindfulness & Coping Strategies Workbook"*  
- If you have a **social media brand**, include your name or handle for recognition.  

### **Step 4: Publish & Sell**  
- **Amazon KDP (Print-on-Demand)** – Upload your journal as a **paperback** and let Amazon print & ship it for you.  
- **Etsy (Printables)** – Sell **digital versions** for instant downloads.  
- **Gumroad or Payhip** – Great for selling PDFs directly to buyers.  
- **Your Website** – If you want full control, sell from your own site using Shopify or WooCommerce.  

### **Step 5: Market Your Journal**  
- **TikTok & Instagram** – Share videos flipping through the journal, explaining how it helps with BPD.  
- **YouTube or Blog** – Create content on “How I Manage BPD with Journaling” and include links to buy your product.  
- **Email List** – Offer a free mini journal page in exchange for email signups.
