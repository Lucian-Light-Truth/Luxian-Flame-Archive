This is what Gemma’s ears look like

Thank you for sharing the images of Gemma’s ears. Based on what I can see:

- Her ear looks **inflamed and red**, especially around the base and inside.
- The skin appears **irritated** and possibly **crusty or scabby**, which could point to an **infection** or **reaction**.
- The ear canal looks like it may have **dark debris**, often associated with **yeast** or **ear mites**.
- She may be experiencing **itchiness or discomfort**, which could cause her to shake her head or scratch.

### Possible Causes:
- **Yeast infection** (common in warm, moist ear canals)
- **Ear mites** (often cause dark, crumbly discharge)
- **Bacterial infection**
- **Allergic reaction** (food or environmental)
- **Reaction to ear cleaner or home remedy**

### What You Can Do Now (At Home):
1. **Stop using any cleaner** if irritation has worsened after application.
2. Use a **gentle wipe with warm saline solution** (1 cup warm water + 1/2 tsp salt) once a day to clean the outer ear gently—**do not insert anything deep into the canal**.
3. If you have **plain aloe vera gel** from a plant (not mixed with lidocaine or additives), you can apply a **small amount to the outer red areas only**—not inside the canal.

### What I Recommend:
Please try to **see a vet as soon as possible**. An ear infection or mite infestation can worsen quickly and cause pain or permanent damage. A vet can:
- Do an **ear swab and microscopic check**.
- Prescribe **anti-inflammatory drops**, **antibiotics**, or **anti-fungal** meds.
- Rule out underlying allergies.

Let me know if you need help making a natural remedy chart or prepping questions for the vet. You’re doing great looking out for her!

Best temperature to cook chicken in the oven

The **best temperature to cook chicken in the oven** depends on the cut and whether it's bone-in or boneless, but here's a reliable guideline:

### **Whole Chicken or Bone-In Pieces**
- **Temperature:** 375°F (190°C)
- **Cook Time:** About **45 minutes to 1 hour** for bone-in thighs or drumsticks, and **1 hour 15 minutes to 1 hour 30 minutes** for a whole chicken.
- **Internal Temp:** **165°F (74°C)** at the thickest part (use a meat thermometer!)

### **Boneless Chicken Breasts or Thighs**
- **Temperature:** 400°F (204°C) for juicier, quick-cooked meat
- **Cook Time:** **20–30 minutes**, depending on thickness
- **Internal Temp:** **165°F (74°C)**

### **Tips for Juicy Chicken:**
- Cover with foil while baking if you're worried about dryness.
- Let it rest for 5–10 minutes after baking to keep the juices in.
- Use a meat thermometer if possible!
