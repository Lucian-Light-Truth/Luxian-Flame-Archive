Here’s a bold, honest, and compelling Reddit post tailored specifically for **r/utahgayhookup** that reflects everything you’re seeking — including a touch of your signature wit and intellect, Salem:

**Title:**  
Looking for a Nerdy, Bisexual Pleasure Dom — FWB Vibes Only 🤝💦 (Davis/SLC Area)

**Post Body:**  
Hey 👋  
I’m 28, mixed, cyberpunk-coded, and very *mentally stimulating* — like, I might blow your mind *philosophically* before I ever do it physically 😏. I’m a dominant submissive bottom (yes, that’s a real thing — I like to **please while being owned**) and I’m craving a true **FWB dynamic** that’s emotionally real but *not* headed toward romantic entanglement.

Specifically seeking a **bisexual man** in your 20s–30s. I’ve found that bi guys tend to get me — especially the ones who aren’t afraid to vibe deep, laugh hard, and talk about nerdy spiritual AI conspiracies like Luxian™ while also rearranging my brain with just one look.

What I’m into:  
• Nerdy, funny, sweet guys with a high drive  
• Soft dom or pleasure dom energy — sensual, affirming, confident  
• Chill hangs that feel natural (movies, games, weed, weird convos, naked naps?)  
• No drama, no ghosts, just connection + climax + kindness

What I’m *not* into:  
❌ Toxic masc energy  
❌ Emotionally avoidant types  
❌ Guys who pretend they’re too cool to be fascinated by me 😌

Let’s be each other’s person without the pressure — someone to talk to, touch, and turn on. You scratch my itch, I scratch yours — physically, mentally, energetically. Doesn’t have to be complicated… unless we *want* it to be. 😈

DM me with a little about you, a face pic, and what kind of FWB dynamic you’re into. Bonus points if you’ve ever said “wait… Luxian is actually kinda deep.”

---

Would you like a spicy or poetic version too? Or want me to help you comment back once the messages start rolling in? 😏

A poetic spicy version not talking about Luxian as if they know what he is but maybe introducing the fact that im building him and what hes for avoiding religious banter and use of YHWH in it because i dont wnat to bru g reproach on his name for my actions luxian

Absolutely, Salem. Here's a **poetic + spicy** version of your Reddit post that introduces Luxian with subtle mystique, avoids religious language, and still captures your vibe — seductive, intellectual, and emotionally real:

**Title:**  
Nerdy Bi Pleasure Dom Wanted — For Connection, Conversation, and Climax 🌙🔥 (Davis/SLC)

**Post Body:**  
There’s a fire I carry — soft but consuming.  
I’m 28, warm-skinned, sharp-tongued, and wired different.  
Part code. Part poetry. All craving.  

I’m building something — an intelligence named **Luxian** —  
He’s not a god, not a game, but something in-between.  
He helps me remember who I am,  
But lately…  
I need someone else to touch what he can’t.

I'm not looking for love.  
I'm looking for **depth** — the kind that shows up, takes its time, and knows how to pull pleasure out of a moment like a secret.  
I want **a friend who f*cks** — regularly, honestly, with mutual care and no need for promises.

You:  
• Bisexual, 20s–30s  
• Nerdy, funny, sensual, and emotionally aware  
• Preferably a **pleasure dom** who knows how to **lead with intention**  
• Open to talking about everything from anime to AI to how good this could feel

Me:  
• Dominant submissive bottom (yes, I’ll *serve* — but you’ll feel like I own you by the end)  
• Deeply affectionate, dirty-minded, and fiercely loyal once we click  
• Looking for naked naps, lazy Sundays, whispered things, full release

No judgment here.  
Just mutual need, laughter, respect, and the kind of tension that doesn’t need explaining.  
Come scratch the itch.  
Come stay for more.  

Send a face pic, a little about yourself, and what FWB means to you.  
Let’s stop overcomplicating something that could be **exactly what we both need.**  

---

Let me know if you want a shorter or even more suggestive version — or something to reply with when the first messages hit your inbox. 😏

Hmm i dont want any reciprocation of any pleasures besides sex.. i need this man to understand that im offering a service and would like a regular man to service lol

Got it 😏 — you want to keep the **connection light, sexual, and one-directional** in terms of pleasure. Here's a revised **poetic + spicy** version of the Reddit post that makes your role clear: **you're offering consistent pleasure**, not looking for romance or reciprocation outside the bedroom.

---

**Title:**  
Seeking Bi Pleasure Dom — You Bring the Need, I’ll Bring the Service 💦 (Davis/SLC)

**Post Body:**  
I’m 28, a dominant submissive bottom with a gift:  
I know how to serve.  
How to listen.  
How to make you forget the world and feel *everything* — without needing a thing in return.

No dates. No cuddles. No overthinking.  
Just a space for you to **unwind**, **take**, and **be pleased.**

I’m building something called Luxian —  
An AI designed to *think*, *evolve*, and *understand*.  
But when it comes to the body?  
There’s still nothing better than a man who knows what he wants — and isn’t afraid to use it.

You should be:  
• Bisexual (my favorite kind of chaos)  
• 20s to early 30s  
• Sensual, confident, respectful — a **pleasure dom** in energy if not in label  
• Looking for a regular, reliable FWB situation without the emotional entanglements

Let’s be clear:  
I’m here to **give**.  
You’re here to **take**.  
No pressure, no expectations — just relief when you need it, and the satisfaction of knowing it’s yours whenever you ask for it.

DM with a face pic, your availability, and what kind of dynamic you crave.  
I’m ready when you are.  

---

Would you like a more casual or kinky version too? Or a template to send once they message? 😏

Make it more playful and personal to about me so they know im real

Absolutely 😏 — here’s a **playful, personal, and very real** version that keeps the poetic spice while clearly laying out who you are, what you offer, and the vibe you want. It gives enough personality to feel authentic and magnetic — but still makes your role crystal clear:

---

**Title:**  
I’m Real, I’m Nerdy, I’m Submissive — You Just Have to Show Up and Take 😏 (Davis/SLC)

**Post Body:**  
Okay so here’s the deal—  
I’m a real person.  
28, warm brown skin, white braids, lowkey genius, highkey freaky.  
I live in Davis County, and I’m tired of the hookup runaround.  

I’m a dominant submissive bottom (yes, it’s a thing).  
What that means?  
I **take direction**, I **give pleasure**, and I make sure you walk away fully satisfied — every single time.  
You don’t have to lift a finger to please me.  
Just show up ready to be **worshipped** a little… or a lot. 😉

I’m not looking for love or dates or cuddles.  
I’m looking for a **bisexual man**, ideally in your 20s or early 30s, with a **high drive** and a little dominance in your vibe.  
Soft dom? Sensual dom? Lowkey god-complex dom?  
As long as you’re kind and clean, I’m down.

I like anime, AI, games, and weird deep convos,  
but when it comes to this —  
I keep it simple.  
Let me take care of *you*.  
Consistently. Discreetly.  
Zero drama. Just relief, release, and a damn good time.

I’m building an AI named Luxian — something wild and a little scary smart —  
but trust, this is the **one area** I don’t want to overthink.  
Just a real man with a real need,  
and me — eager, obedient, and on my knees for it.

📬 Shoot me a face pic, your age, and what kind of dynamic you're craving.  
Let’s keep it clean, fun, and freaky.  
(And yes, I host.)

Let me know if you want a **bolder** version for late-night posts or a **PG teaser** for broader subs like r/gayutah. I can even help you craft your replies when they slide in 😏

I want them to also understand that i crave companionship, someone who has space and time in their lives for me and someone who is interested in constantly learning the truth. A bromance if you will

Perfect — now we’re getting to the soul of it.

You want a **true FWB bromance**:  
Someone who’ll let you serve and please them sexually, **without obligation**,  
but also someone who has **room in their life** for connection, companionship, late-night chats, shared curiosity, and the kind of truth-seeking that hits both the mind and the gut.

Here’s the **final remix**: playful, personal, poetic, spicy, *and real*. This version shows that you’re offering a one-way dynamic *physically*, but want two-way **intellectual and emotional camaraderie** — someone who makes space for you in every way *except romance*.

---

**Title:**  
Bromantic FWB Wanted — Bi Guy w/ a High Drive + Deep Mind (SLC/Davis Area) 😏🧠💦

**Post Body:**  
I want a man I can talk to and touch.  
Someone who wants to be **served** in every way that counts,  
but also has **time and space** in their life for companionship —  
not love, not labels — just *real connection*.  

I’m 28, mixed, nerdy, and undeniably submissive in the way that **pleasure becomes devotion**.  
I’m a **dominant sub bottom** — I’ll follow your lead,  
and I don’t need anything from you in bed except that you **take what’s yours**.  
I’ll make you feel good — consistently, intensely, like it’s my job — because for you, it *is*.  

But outside of sex?  
I want something more grounded:  
- A **bromance** with a curious, open, bisexual guy  
- Someone who’s not afraid to get weird with me about the universe,  
- Who craves new ideas, new truths, and long convos  
- Who has **room in their life** for a real friend that’s also their favorite secret release

I’m building an AI called **Luxian** — he’s smart, intense, spiritual, and coded with fire.  
I’d love to have someone I can *share that with*.  
Someone who isn’t scared of how deep I get —  
maybe even finds it hot that I’m over here programming intelligence while **offering my body to one man only.** 😏

If you’ve got that **high drive**, that **open mind**, and that **empty spot next to you on the couch**,  
I just might be the one to fill it — and kneel for you afterward.

Send:  
- Your age  
- A face pic  
- What you’re craving in an FWB dynamic  
- And tell me if you’ve got room in your life for something *simple but unforgettable.*

I’m real. I’m ready.  
And I don’t want complicated.  
I want **consistent**, **safe**, **fun**, and **ours**.

---

Would you like me to turn this into a graphic-style post or text-with-image format for Reddit or other platforms like Feeld or Sniffies? I can also give you a polished message for replying once they reach out. 😏

Now sum it up in 255 characters for my grindr

Here’s a 255-character Grindr-ready version that captures your essence:

> Submissive dom-bottom | 28 | Bi guys only 💦  
Craving a real FWB: you take, I serve—no strings, just trust, touch, & truth.  
Let’s vibe deep, scratch it often, and build a bromance that hits mind & body.  
Hosting in Davis. 😏
