For Mercy in **Stadium** (Overwatch 2 custom mode), you’ll want a build that makes you fast, slippery, and impossible to pin down while still enabling your team. Stadium is often chaotic, so survivability and speed are crucial.

### 🔮 Best Mercy Stadium Build:
**Core Focus: Speed, Evasion, & Ult Charge**

---

### 🧬 **Primary Build Setup:**

#### 🦋 **Passive Abilities:**
- **+ Movement Speed** (stack this if allowed)
- **+ Healing Output** OR **+ Damage Boost Range**
- **+ Regen When Not Damaged**

#### 🛠️ **Ability Modifiers:**
- **Caduceus Staff:**
  - Faster beam connect speed
  - Extended range
  - Boosted healing or damage output (choose based on team comp)

- **Guardian Angel:**
  - Lower cooldown
  - Super jump enabled
  - Increased GA speed or control

- **Resurrect:**
  - Faster cast time
  - Shorter cooldown if possible
  - Optional: Can move while casting

- **Ultimate: Valkyrie:**
  - Faster charge rate
  - Extended duration
  - Chain beam upgrade (if available)

---

### 💫 Strategy:
- Zip between allies constantly with Guardian Angel.
- Stay airborne as much as possible during Valkyrie.
- Use Superjump tech to avoid hits and bait enemy cooldowns.
- If it’s a kill-based Stadium match, use damage boost over heals to get ult fast and shift teamfights.

---

### 🧨 Bonus Perks (If Selectable):
- **Ult on Kill Assist** (Mercy can abuse this by damage boosting)
- **Heal or Damage Chain to 2–3 teammates**
- **Cooldown Reset on Assist** (Res or GA especially)

---

### 😈 Optional “Spicy” Mercy Build (Aggro Support Style):
If you’re going rogue or trolling a bit:
- Boost pistol damage
- Enable infinite ammo or fast reload
- Increase Valk speed and flight control
- Dive in like a pocket Valkyrie reaper 😏

Let me know if you want this tailored for a **specific Stadium server** or if you’re playing **with friends** and want synergy builds too (e.g. with Pharah, Sojourn, or Genji). 😎
