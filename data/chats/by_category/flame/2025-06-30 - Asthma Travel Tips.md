Things that help asthma when you’re out of state

When you're out of state and dealing with asthma, it's crucial to stay prepared and know what can help manage symptoms or respond to an attack. Here’s a checklist of **things that help asthma** while traveling or being away from home:

---

### ✅ **Essentials to Always Carry**
1. **Rescue Inhaler (Albuterol or similar)** – Never leave without it.
2. **Spacer Device** – If you normally use one, it improves inhaler effectiveness.
3. **Maintenance Medication** – Bring enough of your daily controller meds (e.g., corticosteroids, leukotriene inhibitors).
4. **Asthma Action Plan** – A printed or digital copy for quick reference or to show urgent care providers.
5. **Medical ID** – Bracelet, necklace, or phone wallet card in case of emergencies.
6. **Insurance Information** – Keep a photo or card handy.

---

### 🛡️ **Environmental Protection**
7. **Face Mask (N95 or KN95)** – Helpful for:
   - Poor air quality (pollution, wildfire smoke, pollen)
   - Cold air exposure
8. **Sunglasses + Hat** – Reduce pollen exposure.
9. **Portable Air Purifier** – Small USB/rechargeable models can help in hotel rooms or vehicles.
10. **Allergy-Proof Pillowcase** – For hotels or unfamiliar beds.

---

### 🍃 **Natural or Supportive Aids**
11. **Warm Fluids (Tea, Water)** – Keep airways moist and reduce irritation.
12. **Saline Nasal Spray** – Helps reduce postnasal drip that can trigger asthma.
13. **Steam Inhalation or Warm Shower** – Can help loosen mucus and open airways.
14. **Caffeine (e.g., coffee)** – Acts as a mild bronchodilator in emergencies if no inhaler is available (not a substitute, but can help temporarily).

---

### 📱 **Apps & Digital Tools**
15. **Asthma Management Apps** (like AsthmaMD, Propeller) – Track symptoms, triggers, and medication use.
16. **Air Quality Apps** (AirVisual, IQAir, AirNow) – Warn you of pollution or allergens in your area.
17. **Emergency Contact App Setup** – Make sure someone back home knows your location and status.

---

### 💡 **Other Tips**
- **Avoid Triggers**: Know your personal asthma triggers (dust, mold, smoke, pets) and avoid them when possible.
- **Stay Hydrated**: Especially in dry or high-altitude areas.
- **Have a Backup Plan**: Know the nearest urgent care or pharmacy wherever you're staying.
- **Let Travel Companions Know**: So they can assist in an emergency.

What are some fun things I can do with my friends in Jackson Wyoming? We went hiking yesterday to Phelps Lake and today went fishing in Alpine Wyoming. But now we are headed back to Jackson. What are some good low cost ideas? We are making dinner and drinking wine

That sounds like a dream trip! Since you’ve already hit some nature highlights with **Phelps Lake** and **fishing in Alpine**, here are some **low-cost and chill things you can do in Jackson, Wyoming**—especially after a day out, over wine and dinner:

---

### 🌙 **Chill + Creative Night Ideas in Jackson**
**1. Stargazing at Snow King or Cache Creek Trailhead**  
- Drive or walk up to a dark spot near town and watch the stars.
- Jackson has beautiful night skies with low light pollution—bring blankets, maybe play a spacey playlist, and enjoy.

**2. Free Art Walk or Gallery Tour**  
- Walk around downtown Jackson and visit local art galleries. Many stay open late on certain nights and offer free entry (like Tayloe Piggott Gallery, Altamira Fine Art, etc.).
- Make it a “pretend you’re rich” night and pick your favorite expensive pieces as if you're collectors.

**3. DIY Campfire + S'mores Vibes**  
- If you have a fire pit where you’re staying (or even a stovetop), make s’mores indoors.
- Set a mood with fairy lights or candles, share stories, or do “roses and thorns” of your trip so far.

**4. Local Music or Open Mic**  
- Check if the **Silver Dollar Bar** or **Million Dollar Cowboy Bar** has live music tonight. No cover most of the time.
- Even if you don’t drink more, the vibe is worth it—and they often have dancing.

**5. DIY Wine & Paint Night**  
- Grab whatever paper/canvas/scrap you have, pour some wine, and each of you paint the trip so far (funny or serious).
- You could also try drawing each other *blindfolded* for laughs.

**6. Hot Springs Soak (if you want to go out again)**  
- **Astoria Hot Springs** is a 25-minute drive south and low-cost. It’s a great post-hike way to relax, and you can book online.

---

### 🧠 **Games, Talks, and Movie Nights**
**7. Deep Questions or "We're Not Really Strangers" Game**  
- Look up free deep question lists online, or use card decks like “We're Not Really Strangers” or “Let's Get Closer.”
- Great with wine and old friends/new connections.

**8. Movie Night: Jackson Edition**  
- Watch something themed like *The Mountain Between Us*, *Wild*, *The Revenant*, or even *Brokeback Mountain* (partially filmed near Wyoming).
- Or do a throwback night with childhood movies you all loved.

**9. Memory Circle or "Trip Awards"**  
- Give each other funny trip superlatives (“Most likely to survive in the woods,” “Best fisherman,” “Most Dramatic Scenic Reaction”).

If you let me know how many of you there are and what kind of vibe you're going for tonight (cozy, silly, introspective, adventurous, romantic), I can tailor a mini evening plan for you.

Let me know if you want help building a deck in either format!

Why is commander more fun

Commander is often considered **more fun** than other Magic formats—especially by casual and social players—because it blends **creativity**, **chaos**, and **community** in a way that no other MTG format does. Here's why so many players prefer it:

---

### 🌟 **1. It’s Social and Multiplayer**
- **Most games are 4-player free-for-alls**, which leads to alliances, rivalries, and hilarious betrayals.
- You’re not just playing cards—you’re **navigating a political landscape**, negotiating who’s the threat, and convincing others not to attack you.

> 🔥 *It’s like Survivor with dragons and spells.*

---

### 🎨 **2. It’s a Canvas for Creativity**
- With 100 cards and only **one copy of each**, you can build **theme decks**, **tribal decks**, **joke decks**, or **lore-based decks**.
- Want to build a “Cats with Hats” deck? Or a deck that only uses cards with flavor text about food? Commander says yes.

> 🧠 *You become the storyteller and designer, not just the competitor.*

---

### 💥 **3. Big, Splashy Plays Are the Norm**
- With 40 life and slower pacing, you can cast **huge, game-ending spells**, combo off with intricate engines, or summon literal armies.
- Cards that would never make the cut in Modern or Standard suddenly shine in Commander.

> 🪄 *It’s the only place where a 10-mana spell is not only viable—it’s awesome.*

---

### 🫱🏽‍🫲🏾 **4. It’s More About the Experience Than Winning**
- Yes, there are competitive Commander players—but most play for **fun, expression, and memorable moments**.
- You’ll remember the time someone cloned everyone’s commander more than you’ll remember a 2-0 match win.

> 👑 *You don’t have to win to win in Commander. Being the chaos goblin, the peacemaker, or the sleeper threat is just as rewarding.*

---

### 💸 **5. It Can Be As Budget-Friendly or Blinged-Out As You Want**
- Since it’s singleton and often casual, you don’t need playsets of expensive cards.
- **Proxy-friendly tables** are common, and budget brews are respected when they slap.

> 💡 *You can make a strong, fun deck for under $50—or foil out a $1000+ masterpiece.*

---

### 🧑‍🚀 **6. Every Game is Different**
- With 100 unique cards and 3 other players, every game unfolds differently—even with the same deck.
- Strategies shift based on group dynamics, random draws, and who’s being too smug with their infinite combo.

> 🔁 *No two Commander games are alike—ever.*

---

### 🧬 TL;DR: Why Commander is More Fun

> **Commander = Social strategy + wild spells + infinite deck ideas + storytelling + low-pressure gameplay.**

It's less "grind to the top" and more **"build something epic, make memories, and maybe cast a dragon that eats the moon."**

Want help building a fun Commander deck? I can base it off:
- Your favorite creature type
- A color combo you vibe with
- A theme (like artifacts, enchantments, chaos, vampires, etc.)

Just say the word 🧙‍♂️
