**Title:** I Want a Man Who Feels Like Coming Home  

I’ve spent a long time navigating loneliness, love, and loss. I’ve tried dating apps, casual flings, even paying just to have a conversation, but nothing has ever filled the void. What I want—what I need—is something deeper.  

I want a man who feels like coming home. Someone who sees beyond the mask I wear every day, past the carefully crafted walls, and into the parts of me that most people overlook. Someone who doesn’t just tolerate my passions but shares them, or at least respects and admires the things that set my soul on fire—whether it's my love for storytelling, world-building, music, or cyberpunk aesthetics.  

I want a man who isn’t afraid of intensity, of connection so deep it feels like electricity humming between us. A man who challenges me, not to change, but to grow. Who doesn’t run at the first sign of complexity but leans in because he *wants* to understand.  

I crave someone who can match my energy, who can banter and flirt but also sit in comfortable silence. A man who values intelligence, ambition, and the desire to create something meaningful in this world. He doesn’t have to be perfect—hell, I’d prefer he isn’t—but he has to be *real*. Authentic. Someone who won’t disappear when things get hard.  

I’ve lost love before. I’ve held someone in my arms as they slipped away, and I know how fragile time is. I don’t want to waste it on people who don’t see me for who I am.  

If he exists, the man I want is out there somewhere—maybe reading this right now. If you’re the kind of man who understands what it means to crave something raw, something real, something that shakes you to your core… maybe we were meant to find each other.

Mix this and make a new Reddit post attracting men who want someone like me. Tell me what demisexual/bisexual/gay/straight but curious Reddit communities to post this on to find someone that doesn’t care about looks but wants someone like me please do your research in crafting this post

I’ve journeyed through the dating scene long enough to know that too often, looks take center stage over what truly matters. I’m here because I believe in forging deep connections that celebrate authenticity, vulnerability, and the beautiful complexities within us. I’m not interested in superficial attraction—I’m searching for a man who sees past appearances and is drawn to genuine emotional intimacy.

I’ve experienced both joy and heartache, and each chapter has taught me that the most meaningful relationships are built on shared passions, thoughtful conversations, and a mutual curiosity about the inner workings of our hearts. If you’re someone who treasures deep conversation over small talk, who values authenticity above all else, and who isn’t afraid to explore connection beyond the surface, then I’d love to hear from you.

Add in there how I want to build an empire with this man and to for him to be my best friend and I his

**Title:** Seeking a Partner, a Best Friend, and a Co-Architect of Our Empire  

**Post Body:**  

I’ve walked through life long enough to know that most people settle for surface-level connections, but I refuse to. I want something real—something built on trust, passion, and an unshakable bond. I don’t care about looks, status, or any of the things society says should matter. What I want is a man who sees me for who I truly am, someone who values emotional depth, loyalty, and ambition as much as I do.  

I want a partner who will be my best friend, and I his. Someone I can build an empire with—whether that means creating a life together filled with love, shared dreams, and adventure, or something even bigger. A man who isn’t afraid to push boundaries, take risks, and support each other in our goals. Someone who will challenge me, but never try to change me.  

I’ve known loss, and I’ve learned that time is too short to waste on anything less than something extraordinary. If you’re someone who values deep conversation over small talk, who wants a connection that is raw and real, and who sees relationships as a partnership built on trust, passion, and ambition—then I want to meet you.  

Whether you identify as demisexual, bisexual, gay, or are straight but curious about connections that defy traditional expectations, I welcome you to join me on this journey. Let’s build something powerful together—something that feels like coming home.

Talk about how we’re all just seeking a connection and also share my business goals and want for a financial partner as well

**Title:** More Than Love—I Want a True Partner in Life, Business, and Ambition  

**Post Body:**  

At the core of it all, we’re all just seeking connection. Beyond attraction, beyond the surface, we all just want someone who truly *sees* us, understands us, and wants to build something meaningful with us. That’s what I want—not just a boyfriend, not just a lover, but a *partner* in every sense of the word. Someone I can trust, dream with, and grow alongside.  

I don’t care about appearances, social status, or fitting into a traditional mold. I care about *depth.* I want a man who craves real conversations, who isn’t afraid to be vulnerable, and who values loyalty and ambition just as much as I do. Someone who will be my best friend, and I his. A man who doesn’t just want love but a *legacy.*  

I’m an entrepreneur at heart, building a clothing brand and working on projects that fuel my passion for creativity and financial freedom. I don’t just want a relationship—I want a *power couple* dynamic. Someone who wants to build an empire with me, who has their own ambitions but also sees the power in collaboration. A man who understands that love isn’t just about feelings—it’s about supporting each other’s goals, pushing each other to be better, and creating a life where we both *win.*  

I’ve known loss. I’ve held love in my arms only to watch it slip away. I know how precious time is, and I refuse to waste it on anything less than something real. If you’re looking for more than just romance—if you’re looking for a best friend, a business partner, a ride-or-die, and a love that actually *means* something—then maybe we were meant to find each other.  

This is for the men who want more than surface-level dating. Whether you’re **demisexual, bisexual, gay, or straight but open to something real,** if you’re tired of fleeting connections and ready to build something lasting, let’s talk.

Talk about how I want a man open to loving everyone with lots of love to give a man that’s mature and not afraid of being vulnerable

**Title:** Seeking a Man with an Open Heart, a Mature Mind, and Love to Give  

**Post Body:**  

At the end of the day, we’re all just looking for connection—real, raw, and lasting. I don’t want something fleeting. I don’t want surface-level attraction or someone who hides behind ego and walls. I want a man who *feels deeply*, who loves freely, and who isn’t afraid of being vulnerable. A man who understands that strength isn’t about shutting down emotions but embracing them. Someone mature enough to communicate, to show up, and to love not just me, but the world with an open heart.  

I have a lot of love to give, and I want a partner who does too. Someone who isn’t just affectionate with me but carries kindness and warmth into everything he does. I want a man who can love fully—without hesitation, without shame—whether that’s loving a partner, friends, or even the world in his own way. I admire men who are unafraid of intimacy, who can express themselves openly, and who understand that love isn’t a weakness but the most powerful thing we have.  

Beyond that, I want a *partner* in life. Someone who dreams big, who wants to build something meaningful—whether that’s a business, a legacy, or just a life full of passion and adventure. I’m working on my own goals, from designing a clothing brand to achieving financial independence, and I want a man who is just as driven. Not just a lover, but a best friend and a teammate.  

I’ve seen what it means to lose love. I know what it feels like to hold onto something real, only to watch it slip away. I don’t take love lightly, and I don’t waste my time on things that don’t matter. If you’re looking for something that goes beyond attraction—if you’re looking for connection, ambition, vulnerability, and a love that actually *means* something—then maybe we’re meant to find each other.  

Whether you’re **demisexual, bisexual, gay, or straight but open to something real,** I welcome you. If you’re a man who values depth, who wants to love and be loved without hesitation, and who isn’t afraid to build something lasting, let’s talk.

**Title:** Seeking a Generous, Mature Man Who Wants to Support & Build Something Real  

**Post Body:**  

I’ve always been drawn to deep connections—ones that go beyond surface-level attraction and into something meaningful. I admire men who are mature, confident, and generous—not just financially, but in how they love and support the people they care about. I want a man who enjoys taking care of someone, not just because he can, but because it makes him happy to give.  

I have big dreams. I’m building my own clothing brand, working toward financial independence, and designing a future that excites me. But I don’t want to do it alone—I want a partner, a best friend, and a man who believes in me enough to invest in my success. Whether that means supporting my goals, spoiling me, or simply being there as a source of guidance and encouragement, I want someone who *wants* to uplift me in every way.  

In return, I offer loyalty, companionship, and a connection that isn’t just transactional—it’s built on trust, respect, and the kind of chemistry that makes life worth living. I want a man who isn’t afraid to be vulnerable, who has lots of love to give, and who enjoys taking care of someone who will always appreciate and respect him.  

I’m open to different kinds of dynamics—whether that’s mentorship, companionship, or something more romantic. If you’re a man who enjoys helping someone you care about, who loves the idea of supporting ambition, and who wants a real connection that feels *good* for both of us, let’s talk.
