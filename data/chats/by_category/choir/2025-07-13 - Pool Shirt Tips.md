Summary: If youâ€™re just chilling in the pool and want to stay comfy and confident, hereâ€™s what works best:

### ðŸ”¹ **Best Type of Shirt:**
**Rash Guard or Swim Shirt (Short Sleeve or Long Sleeve)**  
- Designed for water â€” dries fast, doesnâ€™t cling as much as cotton  
- Offers UV protection (bonus if youâ€™re in the sun)  
- Doesnâ€™t billow up in the water like a regular T-shirt

You can find them in basic black, navy, charcoal, or dark forest green â€” all slimming colors. ---

### ðŸ”¸ **Best Colors:**
- **Dark colors** like **black, navy, or deep grey** are the most flattering and help conceal any cling or wet spots. ---

### ðŸ”¹ **If You Donâ€™t Have a Swim Shirt:**
A **dark athletic shirt** or a **moisture-wicking workout tee** (polyester or spandex blend) is your next best bet.
