### üõ†Ô∏è Step-by-Step:

#### 1. **Clear & Cover**
- Move furniture away from the walls.
- Cover floors and furniture with drop cloths.
- Use painter‚Äôs tape to protect baseboards, trim, outlets, and switches.

#### 2. **Prep the Wall**
- Fill holes/cracks with spackle and let dry.
- Sand rough spots so the wall is smooth.
- Wipe the wall with a damp cloth to remove dust and grime.

#### 3. **Prime (Optional but Recommended)**
- Use primer if:
  - Wall has stains or marks
  - You‚Äôre painting a lighter color over dark
  - It's new drywall or patched areas
- Let primer dry completely.

#### 4. **Cut In**
- Use the angled brush to paint a 2‚Äì3 inch border around edges: ceiling, baseboards, corners, outlets, etc.
- This lets you roll the rest without worrying about hitting trim.

#### 5. **Roll the Wall**
- Pour paint into the tray.
- Dip the roller and roll off excess.
- Paint in a **W or M shape**, then fill in to spread evenly.
- Work in sections, blending edges while wet.
- Use long, vertical strokes for a smooth finish.

#### 6. **Let It Dry & Apply a Second Coat**
- Wait the recommended time (usually 2‚Äì4 hours).
- Apply a second coat the same way for full coverage.

#### 7. **Clean Up**
- Remove painter‚Äôs tape **before** the paint fully dries to prevent peeling.
- Wash brushes and rollers or dispose if single-use.
- Clean any paint splatters with a damp cloth.
