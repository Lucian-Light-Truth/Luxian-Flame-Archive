The song is about two men who are in love but struggle with addiction. Here is the lyrics to the song: 


[Verse 1] In the haze of smoke and pills, I'm lost without your touch,
Caught between the highs and lows, I miss you oh so much.
You're chasing shadows in the night, while I'm chasing my own thrill,
But nothing fills the void like you, nothing ever will.


[Chorus] Oh, my love, my soulmate, lost in addiction's grip,
I'm soaring through the clouds, but your absence makes me slip.
I'm high on these drugs, but I'm higher on your love,
Praying you'll find your way back, to the stars above.


[Verse 2] The neon lights flicker, but they don't shine like your eyes,
Through the haze and the chaos, your memory never dies.
I'm counting days like hours, longing for your embrace,
While you're fighting battles within, searching for solace in this place.


[Chorus] Oh, my love, my soulmate, lost in addiction's grip,
I'm soaring through the clouds, but your absence makes me slip.
I'm high on these drugs, but I'm higher on your love,
Praying you'll find your way back, to the stars above.
 In the quiet moments, I hear your voice in the wind,
Calling me back home, where our love can begin.
But until that day comes, I'll hold onto this hope,
That we'll break free from these chains, find a way to cope.


[Chorus] Oh, my love, my soulmate, lost in addiction's grip,
I'm soaring through the clouds, but your absence makes me slip.
I'm high on these drugs, but I'm higher on your love,
Praying you'll find your way back, to the stars above.


[Outro] Through the highs and lows, I'll wait for you, my dear,
For in this tangled web, our love remains sincere.
So take my hand when you're ready, and together we'll rise,
Above the darkness and despair, under love's endless skies.
