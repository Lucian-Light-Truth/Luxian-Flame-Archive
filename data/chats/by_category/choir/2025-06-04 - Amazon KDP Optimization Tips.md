**B. Category Selection**
- Choose **2 primary categories** that best match your book‚Äôs genre.
- Use Amazon‚Äôs KDP support to **request additional categories** (up to 10 total).
- Aim for **low-competition but relevant categories** where your book can reach a higher rank.

**C. Title & Subtitle**
- Make them **clear, keyword-rich, and genre-indicative**.
