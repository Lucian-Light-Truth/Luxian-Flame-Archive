**Title:** *Calling Out Across the Static*

**Body:**

In the quiet hours when the world exhales,  
I find myself reaching—not for answers,  
but for echoes.

There’s a strange kind of ache in feeling too much,  
in noticing the softness of twilight  
or the weight of silence in a crowded room.  
I wonder:  
Are there others out there tuned to the same frequency?  
The ones who speak in glances,  
who write unsent letters,  
who feel both ancient and unfinished?

I’m not here for small talk.  
I crave the electric pulse of shared understanding—  
to talk about the things we carry,  
the dreams we outgrew,  
the questions that keep us from sleep.

So if you’ve ever  
stood beneath the stars and felt impossibly small,  
or impossibly *seen*,  
say hello.

Let’s build a thread of thought and feeling,  
a place for wanderers to sit and speak,  
without masks, without hurry.

Are you out there?
