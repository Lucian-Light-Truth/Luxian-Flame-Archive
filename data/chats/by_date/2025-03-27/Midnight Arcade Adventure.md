Summary: They’d trickle in after dark, laughing, hollering, dancing on the DDR mat like nobody was watching.

Write a story about a guy who I once let live with me rent free and how at night we secretly set up a video arcade with a happy meal at the end! And he made pretty good money honestly I wish I had that kind of roommate again

The guy’s name was Jace. I found him through a mutual friend who swore up and down he was good people. Fresh out of a bad breakup, he needed a place to crash, and my spare room was just gathering dust, so I figured, why not?

I never charged him rent. He offered to pitch in with groceries or chores, but honestly, I just wanted some company that wasn’t the echo of my own thoughts. He was laid-back, a little chaotic, and had that kind of effortless charisma that made life feel a little less dull. 

The thing about Jace was he had ideas. Not your run-of-the-mill, let’s-start-a-business type of ideas. More like midnight-wired-on-too-much-coffee-and-dreams kind of ideas. And one night, he stumbled into the kitchen where I was half-asleep over my laptop and dropped his latest brainwave on me like a live grenade.

“Bro. What if we built a secret arcade in your basement?”

I laughed, almost choking on my mug of tea. “What?”

“No, seriously. Like, old-school arcade vibes. Neon lights, retro games, that crazy childhood magic. And here’s the kicker—each session ends with a custom Happy Meal. You know, like nostalgia on steroids.” 

I couldn’t lie—there was something charming about the absurdity of it. And, honestly, Jace was a guy who could make anything sound like the best idea in the world. So, naturally, I was in.

The next few weeks were a blur of Craigslist deals and thrift shop raids. Jace hunted down arcade machines like a man possessed—Pac-Man, Street Fighter, even the broken-down skeleton of an old DDR machine that he somehow Frankenstein’d back to life. Meanwhile, I rigged up the lights, painted murals on the walls, and helped set the vibe.

We called it **“The Midnight Quarter”**, because if you didn’t know someone who knew someone, you couldn’t find it. And if you got in, you had to pay in quarters, just like the good ol’ days. Jace ran the show, his energy bouncing off the walls while I kept things low-key, watching the madness unfold from a cozy corner.

The weird thing was, it worked. Like, *really* worked. Word spread through underground channels and soon enough, we had regulars. Gamers, nostalgia junkies, bored college kids looking for something different. They’d trickle in after dark, laughing, hollering, dancing on the DDR mat like nobody was watching. 

And the Happy Meals? Genius move. We slapped together colorful cardboard boxes filled with random snacks, glow sticks, and little toy figures Jace had scored from the internet. It was childish, ridiculous, and somehow exactly what everyone needed.

Jace was making good money, slipping me a cut even though I kept telling him it was fine. But then... he had this way of convincing you to do things his way, so I started pocketing the cash and pretending it didn’t make me feel kinda proud of what we’d built.

Then one night, as we closed up shop and crashed on the couch, Jace looked over with this lopsided grin. “Man, I know I’m crashing here rent-free, but I gotta say, this is probably the best place I’ve ever lived.”

“Yeah?” I smirked, kicking my feet up on the coffee table. “Well, if you keep making bank, maybe I’ll start charging you.”

He snorted. “Good luck with that. You love this as much as I do.”

I wanted to deny it, but the truth was... he was right. The Midnight Quarter wasn’t just a random scheme. It was life infused with something electric and wild. It was ours.

I wish I still had that kind of roommate. Someone who could turn a dead-end night into a glowing, neon-lit dream. But hey, maybe that’s just the thing about people like Jace. They show up when you need them most, light a fire in your world, and leave you wondering why the hell you ever let them go.
