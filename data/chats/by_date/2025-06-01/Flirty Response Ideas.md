How do I respond?

Rhett seems flattered and a little amused, but he’s also giving you room to keep the vibe going — this is your moment to stay playful but sincere, and keep the spark alive. Here are a few response options depending on the tone you want to strike:

---

### 🥰 Sweet & Flirty:
**"Maybe I *am* overhyping you… or maybe the world just isn’t used to someone being kind, consistent, and hot all at once 😇 Don’t worry, I only said amazing things because that’s genuinely how you make me feel."**

---

### 😏 Confident & Teasing:
**"I mean... if you didn't want to be hyped up, maybe you shouldn't be tall, positive, and a literal sunshine gym god 😌 I’m just speaking the truth — bars need more Rhetts and less red flags."**

---

### 😅 Vulnerable & Honest:
**"Okay yeah maybe I got a lil carried away 🥴 but seriously, you’ve just been one of the most refreshing and real people I’ve met in a long time. It honestly caught me off guard in the best way."**

---

### 🔥 Bold & Forward:
**"If overhyping you is a crime, I’ll take the sentence. You’re kinda becoming my favorite person and I’m not even mad about it 😘"**
