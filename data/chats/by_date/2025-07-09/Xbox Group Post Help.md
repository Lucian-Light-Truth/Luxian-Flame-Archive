Summary: I met a girl online that’s 22 and she likes playing Overwatch 2. She searches for groups on Xbox to play with doing 6v6. Looking for 21+ we are looking to play 6v6 on Overwatch, and have fun and make friends.

Looking for 21+ we are looking to play 6v6 on Overwatch, and have fun and make friends. Play some custom games, and party together in the Xbox party haha. 

Must have a mic, and we need 4 others.

Looking for chill, fun and open guys and gals. Potentially 3 other guys and 1 other girl. 

Kinda want flirty LGBT vibes tbh so that we can all talk and get to know each other and either be good fun friends or flirty fun friends.

Don’t want anyone to be weird unless it’s a good weird like me lmao and also people always just join and leave. So we don’t want that. We want people to talk.

Lux, can you research how Xbox Group Looking Posts work and what tags and character count is available. Then please generate a poster can use to find the right people :)

Here’s what I found about Xbox/Overwatch 2 “Looking For Group” (LFG) posts and how to craft a standout one:

### 🧭 LFG Post Guidelines & Structure

- Favor **clear titles (≈50 characters max)** to highlight who you are and what you’re looking for citeturn0search5.
- Common tags include: **LFG** (“Looking For Group”), **LFM** (“Looking For More”), voice-chat requirement, platform, and age limits citeturn0search8turn0search5.
- Specify: platform (Xbox), game mode (6v6 custom/quick play), roles, age restrictions (21+), mic requirement, chill vibes, and any social preferences (LGBT-flirty etc.).
- Keep the **total description concise but inviting**—no need for essays.

### 🎯 Sample Xbox LFG Post

**Title (≤50 chars):**  
```
LFG 21+ 6v6 OW2 – Chill LGBT flirt vibes
```

**Body:**  
```
🎮 2 plat/diamond Xbox players (M+F, 21+) seeking 4 more (3 guys + 1 gal)  
🗣️ Must have mic & join Xbox party – no silent join/leaves, please!  
❤️ Looking for chill, friendly players with fun/open energy  
🌈 LGBT‑flirty vibes welcome – friendly banter & voice chat is key  
🎯 We’ll queue 6v6 QP/custom, party chat, amd game together  
✨ If you’re 21+, got voice & stick around to chat/fill roles, hit me up!
```

That’s right at ~300 characters—not counting emojis—and hits all the key points:
- Who you are & platform  
- Age limit & mic requirement  
- Desired vibe (chill, LGBT-flirty)  
- Game style  
- Invitation to connect

### ✅ Pro Tips

- Use emojis sparingly—they catch eyes but keep it clean.
- Be concise—filter settings may limit title length.
- Refresh your post occasionally so it stays visible.
- Combine **LFG** and **LFM** keywords in title or tags to maximize reach.
- If possible, mention roles (DPS/Tank/Support) or SR range to set expectations.

Let me know if you want a version with SR limits, specific hero roles, or tweaked tone!
