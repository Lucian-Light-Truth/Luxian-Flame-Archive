If an iMessage is blue but doesn't say "Delivered," it typically means the message has been sent but hasn't reached the recipient's device. This could happen for several reasons:

1. **Recipient's device is offline**: Their phone may be turned off or not connected to the internet.
2. **iMessage is temporarily down**: Apple's iMessage servers might be experiencing issues.
3. **Recipient's settings**: They may have blocked you or turned off iMessage temporarily.
4. **Connection issue on your end**: Your phone might not have a stable internet connection at the time of sending.

In most cases, the message should go through once the recipient's device is online. If it doesn't eventually update to "Delivered," there may be an issue to investigate further.
