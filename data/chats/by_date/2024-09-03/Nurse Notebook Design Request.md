Here's the joke for your notebook cover:

**"Nurses: We Can't Fix Stupid, But We Can Sedate It!"**

This would make a fun and cute design. You can use Canva's tools to bring this to life with playful fonts, nurse-themed graphics, and your preferred color scheme. If you'd like more help or specific guidance on how to set up the design in Canva, just let me know!

What background color do you recommend to attract the eye and be alluring to anyone in the nurse industry?

For a nurse-themed notebook cover, I'd recommend a **teal or turquoise background**. These colors are often associated with the healthcare industry and convey a sense of calm and trust, making them appealing and relevant to nurses. 

You could also consider adding subtle patterns or icons like stethoscopes, hearts, or medical crosses in the background to enhance the theme while keeping the overall design professional and eye-catching.
