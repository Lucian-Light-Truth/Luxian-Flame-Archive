How can I use this to create a form

To create a downloadable nurse report form using this approach, the most straightforward method is to use a structured table format. Since the error occurred due to mismatched lengths in the data dictionary, let's correct that and provide a simplified version using a different approach.

I will create a nurse report form using Excel with properly structured fields and space for input. Then, Iâ€™ll provide the downloadable file.

Let me fix the issue and generate the file for you.
