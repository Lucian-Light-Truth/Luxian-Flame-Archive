Summary: - **It meets at least the minimum octane rating in your owner’s manual** — most 2015 Renegades with the 2.4L Tigershark or 1.4L MultiAir engines are designed for **87 octane or higher**. **Check spark plugs**  
   - If they’re worn, replacing them can make the biggest difference in smoothness. - **Air Filter**: Pull yours out — if it’s dark or clogged, replace it ($12–$20 online/Walmart).

Can i put 88 ethanol free gas in a 2015 Jeep Renegade?

Yes — your 2015 Jeep Renegade can safely run on 88 octane ethanol-free gasoline, as long as:  

- **It’s regular unleaded** (not E85, which is 85% ethanol).  
- **It meets at least the minimum octane rating in your owner’s manual** — most 2015 Renegades with the 2.4L Tigershark or 1.4L MultiAir engines are designed for **87 octane or higher**. So 88 is fine.  
- **It’s true ethanol-free** and not labeled as “Flex Fuel” or “E85.”  

Ethanol-free fuel can even give you slightly better mileage and performance compared to E10 blends, especially in older vehicles or if you store the Jeep for periods of time.  

Do you want me to check exactly what octane Jeep recommended for your specific 2015 Renegade engine? That way you’ll know for sure you’re giving it the optimal fuel.

Its actually a 2017 Renegade Altitude 4x4 2.4 liter I4 MultiAir Engine

Got it — for your **2017 Jeep Renegade Altitude 4x4** with the **2.4L I4 MultiAir** engine, Jeep recommends:  

- **Minimum octane:** **87 AKI** (Anti-Knock Index, the number posted on U.S. pumps).  
- **Fuel type:** Unleaded gasoline only.  
- **Ethanol content:** Up to **10% ethanol** is fine, but ethanol-free is also perfectly safe.  
- **No E85** — it’s not a flex-fuel engine.  

So yes — **88 octane ethanol-free gas** is **totally safe** for your engine. In fact, it might give you slightly better mileage than E10 blends because ethanol-free fuel has a bit more energy per gallon.  

If you want, I can also tell you **when it actually makes sense to spend extra on ethanol-free** and when it’s just a feel-good upgrade. That’ll help you decide if it’s worth it long term.

Yes tell me please

Alright — here’s the breakdown on when **ethanol-free 88 octane** is actually worth it for your 2017 Renegade, and when it’s just a nice splurge:  

---

## ✅ **Worth it** if:
1. **You want maximum fuel efficiency**  
   - Ethanol-free has ~3–4% more energy per gallon than E10.  
   - You might see **+1–2 mpg** on highway driving.  

2. **You don’t drive often / vehicle sits for weeks or months**  
   - Ethanol absorbs moisture over time, which can cause corrosion in the fuel system.  
   - Ethanol-free is more stable for storage — great for seasonal use or low-mileage drivers.  

3. **You want smoother cold starts** (especially in winter)  
   - Ethanol-free gas vaporizes more consistently in cold weather, so it can make starts a bit quicker and smoother.

4. **You tow or carry heavy loads often**  
   - Slightly higher energy content can help maintain performance when the engine is under strain.

---

## ⚠️ **Not really worth it** if:
1. **You drive daily and burn through a tank every week or two**  
   - Ethanol’s long-term storage issues won’t matter — you’ll use it before it causes problems.  
   - The extra mpg often doesn’t fully offset the higher price.

2. **The price gap is huge**  
   - If ethanol-free is **$0.50+ more per gallon**, the fuel economy gains probably won’t cover the cost.  
   - Example: If you get 26 mpg on E10 and 27 mpg on ethanol-free, you’d save ~$1–$2 per tank in fuel usage — but if you paid $5 extra for the tank, it’s a loss.

3. **You think it will dramatically boost power**  
   - Your Renegade’s engine is tuned for regular 87 octane, so you won’t see a horsepower jump — just slightly smoother running.

---

💡 **Bottom line for your Jeep:**  
Ethanol-free 88 is best if your Renegade sits unused for weeks, you want every bit of fuel efficiency, or the price gap is small. If it’s a daily driver and ethanol-free is way pricier, E10 87 will run just as well without hurting your engine.

If you want, I can run you a **quick fuel cost & MPG gain calculator** so you can see exactly how much you’d save (or spend) per year using ethanol-free in your specific driving habits. That way you’ll have a numbers-based answer.

Well the jeep needs an oil change and hasnt been incredibly well maintained so i wanna know if its worth it to help ot run smoother and i will still get an oil change tomorrow

Gotcha — in your case, where the **Jeep hasn’t been perfectly maintained** and is due for an oil change, running **88 ethanol-free** for a bit **can** help things feel smoother — but it won’t magically fix mechanical wear.  

Here’s how it’ll actually play out:  

---

### **What ethanol-free will help with right now**
- **Smoother idle & throttle response**  
  The slightly higher octane and cleaner burn can reduce knock and hesitation, especially if there’s carbon buildup.
- **Less moisture & cleaner fuel system**  
  No ethanol means less water absorption, which is good if it’s been sitting or hasn’t had fresh gas in a while.
- **Possible minor mpg bump**  
  You might notice a small improvement in fuel economy after a couple tanks.

---

### **What will help even more**  
Since you’re already planning the oil change tomorrow, if you want it to run noticeably better, I’d recommend:  
1. **Oil & filter change** (you’re already on it ✅)  
   - Fresh oil = smoother, quieter engine.
2. **Replace the air filter** (cheap, easy)  
   - If it’s clogged, power and mpg suffer a lot.
3. **Run a fuel system cleaner**  
   - Something like **Chevron Techron Concentrate Plus** or **Sea Foam** in the first ethanol-free tank will help clean injectors and intake valves.  
4. **Check spark plugs**  
   - If they’re worn, replacing them can make the biggest difference in smoothness.

---

💡 **Best move for you right now:**  
- Get the oil change ✅  
- Fill up with 88 ethanol-free + add a quality fuel system cleaner  
- Swap the air filter if it’s dirty (you can check it in 2 minutes)  

This combo will **absolutely make it run smoother** and help undo some of the neglect — way more than just switching fuel alone.  

---

If you want, I can give you a **one-week “Jeep Smooth-Out Plan”** that stacks the quick, cheap maintenance steps so by next weekend it’ll feel almost like a different vehicle without big repair bills. That’ll make your ethanol-free fill-ups count even more.

## 🛠 **What You’ll Need for the Oil Change**
*(You can get everything at Walmart, AutoZone, or O’Reilly — I’ll mark “optional” items you can skip if tight on budget.)*

### **Supplies**
- **5 quarts** of oil:  
  - Recommended: **0W-20 full synthetic** (Mobil 1, Castrol, or Walmart’s SuperTech synthetic are fine).  
  - About $25–$30 for 5 qt.
- **Oil filter**:  
  - For your 2.4L, you need **Mopar MO-349** or equivalent (Fram CH11665, Wix WL10255, etc.) — $6–$10.
- **Oil filter wrench** (cap-style fits over the filter, ~$5–$7).
- **Socket wrench + correct socket** for the drain plug (should be 13mm for your Renegade).
- **Drain pan** (to catch old oil — ~$5–$7).
- **Funnel** (cheap plastic one is fine).
- **Gloves** (optional, but nice for keeping clean).
- **Rags or paper towels**.

---

## 🛠 **DIY Oil Change Steps** (for your 2017 Renegade)
1. **Warm up the engine slightly**  
   - Let it run 2–3 minutes so oil flows out easier.  
   - Turn it off and make sure it’s on a flat surface.

2. **Lift the Jeep (if needed)**  
   - Your Renegade has decent clearance — you *may* not need to jack it up. If you do, use ramps or a jack + jack stands for safety.

3. **Locate the oil drain plug**  
   - Crawl under from the front — you’ll see the drain plug on the bottom of the oil pan (toward the center).

4. **Place the drain pan under the plug**  
   - Give yourself a little space so oil won’t splash over the edge.

5. **Remove the drain plug** (13mm socket)  
   - Turn counterclockwise — oil will start flowing.  
   - Let it drain completely (5–10 minutes).

6. **Remove the oil filter**  
   - Use your oil filter wrench to loosen it (it’s on the front of the engine).  
   - Be ready — more oil will drip out.

7. **Install the new oil filter**  
   - Put a bit of fresh oil on the rubber gasket so it seals well.  
   - Screw it on by hand until snug — don’t over-tighten.

8. **Reinstall the drain plug**  
   - Make sure the washer is still good (if it’s damaged, replace it). Tighten snugly but don’t over-torque.

9. **Add new oil**  
   - Remove the oil fill cap on top of the engine.  
   - Using a funnel, pour in about **4.5 quarts**, then check the dipstick.  
   - Add more until it’s at the “Full” mark (should be about 5 quarts total).

10. **Start the engine & check for leaks**  
    - Let it run 1–2 minutes, look underneath for drips.  
    - Shut it off and check the dipstick again — top up if needed.

11. **Dispose of old oil properly**  
    - Most auto parts stores will take it for free.
