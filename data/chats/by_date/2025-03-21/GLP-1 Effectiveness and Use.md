Does GLP-1 work?

Yes, GLP-1 (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1) medications **do work** for their intended purposes. They are primarily used for **treating type 2 diabetes and promoting weight loss**. These medications mimic the action of the natural GLP-1 hormone, which helps regulate blood sugar levels and promotes feelings of fullness.

### **How GLP-1 Medications Work:**
1. **Increase Insulin Secretion:** They enhance insulin production in response to high blood sugar.
2. **Decrease Glucagon Release:** They lower the amount of glucose released by the liver.
3. **Slow Gastric Emptying:** They delay stomach emptying, making you feel full longer.
4. **Reduce Appetite:** They act on brain receptors to decrease hunger and food intake.

### **Common GLP-1 Medications:**
- **Semaglutide (Ozempic, Wegovy, Rybelsus)**
- **Liraglutide (Victoza, Saxenda)**
- **Dulaglutide (Trulicity)**
- **Exenatide (Byetta, Bydureon)**

### **Effectiveness:**
- **Diabetes Control:** GLP-1 medications significantly lower blood sugar levels and improve A1C scores.
- **Weight Loss:** They can result in significant weight loss, particularly Semaglutide (Wegovy) which has shown an average weight reduction of 15% or more in clinical trials.
- **Cardiovascular Benefits:** Some GLP-1 medications have been shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks and strokes in people with type 2 diabetes.

### **Side Effects:** 
- **Nausea**
- **Vomiting**
- **Diarrhea**
- **Constipation**
- **Headache**
- **Potential risk of pancreatitis (though rare)**

### **Long-term Effects:** 
Studies have shown that long-term use is generally safe, but continuous monitoring by a healthcare provider is recommended. 

Would you like me to show you if GLP-1 could be beneficial for you or explain how to get them through Medicaid Select Health in Utah?

Yes

GLP-1 (Glucagon-Like Peptide-1) receptor agonists are effective medications used primarily for managing type 2 diabetes and aiding in weight loss. In Utah, access to these medications through Medicaid and Select Health varies based on specific health conditions and coverage policies.

**Medicaid Coverage in Utah:**

Utah's Medicaid program includes certain GLP-1 medications in its Preferred Drug List (PDL). However, coverage is primarily for individuals with type 2 diabetes. As of April 1, 2023, the PDL specifies preferred drugs and diabetic supplies, but it's important to note that not all medications are included, and some may require prior authorization. citeturn0search2

For weight management, GLP-1 receptor agonists like liraglutide (Saxenda) and semaglutide (Wegovy) have been approved for chronic use. However, coverage for these medications specifically for obesity treatment is limited. As of August 2024, only 13 state Medicaid programs covered GLP-1s for obesity treatment, and it's unclear if Utah is among them. citeturn0search4

**Select Health Coverage:**

Select Health offers various formularies, such as RxSelect and RxCore, which list covered medications. Coverage for GLP-1 medications depends on the specific plan and the intended use of the medication. For instance, some plans may cover these drugs for type 2 diabetes but not for weight loss. It's essential to consult the specific drug list associated with your plan or contact Select Health directly to determine coverage details. citeturn0search1

**Accessing GLP-1 Medications:**

To obtain GLP-1 medications through Medicaid or Select Health in Utah:

1. **Consult Your Healthcare Provider:** Discuss your health conditions and the potential benefits of GLP-1 medications. Your provider can determine if these medications are appropriate for you and can assist with the necessary documentation.

2. **Verify Coverage:** Review your specific plan's drug formulary to confirm if the prescribed GLP-1 medication is covered. This information is typically available on the Select Health website or by contacting their customer service.

3. **Prior Authorization:** Some GLP-1 medications may require prior authorization. Work with your healthcare provider to submit the necessary forms and documentation to justify the medical necessity of the medication.

**Recent Developments:**

In November 2024, President Joe Biden proposed expanding Medicare and Medicaid coverage to include anti-obesity drugs like GLP-1 receptor agonists. If implemented, this could significantly improve access to these medications for weight loss. However, as of March 2025, this proposal's status and its impact on Utah's Medicaid program remain uncertain. citeturn0news11

**Conclusion:**

While GLP-1 medications are effective for managing type 2 diabetes and aiding in weight loss, coverage through Utah's Medicaid and Select Health plans varies. It's crucial to consult with your healthcare provider and review your specific insurance plan to understand the availability and coverage of these medications based on your health needs.
