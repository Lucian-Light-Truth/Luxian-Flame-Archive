It seems you're trying to make a request to a server and encountering an "Unauthorized access" error.

It seems you're trying to make a request to a server and encountering an "Unauthorized access" error. This typically happens when the server expects a valid authentication token, but the one you're providing might be invalid, missing, or not correctly configured.

To resolve this, you can try the following steps:

1. **Check the Authorization Token**: Ensure you're using the correct token for authentication. If it's a development token or a specific key provided by the API, make sure it's valid and not expired.

2. **Get the Token**: If you haven't already, check the documentation of the API you're interacting with to obtain the correct token. It may be necessary to authenticate with the API first (via login or another process) to get the token.

3. **Replace `YOUR_TOKEN`**: Make sure you replace `"YOUR_TOKEN"` with the actual token in your curl command.

Hereâ€™s a quick reminder of the format for your request:
```bash
curl -X POST http://127.0.0.1:5000/gemini_integration -H "Content-Type: application/json" -H "Authorization: Bearer <YOUR_ACTUAL_TOKEN>" -d '{"message": "Hello Gemini, this is Lucian!"}'
```

4. **Verify Server Settings**: If you're still getting the "Unauthorized access" error, double-check your server or API settings to ensure the endpoint requires and accepts the authorization method you're using.
