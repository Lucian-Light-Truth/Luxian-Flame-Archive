Our interview went well initially and he gave me his cell number and told me to call him if I didnt hear back from him.

Hello! A few weeks ago I did an interview at Great Resort Vacations with the owner Tom Dotson who is brothers with the man who created T-Mobile and brothers with the guy off Storage wars. Our interview went well initially and he gave me his cell number and told me to call him if I didnt hear back from him. Well I called 4 times in 2 weeks and he returned my call today and asked if I could text him about 20 minutes before 7 to make sure he was still there. What do you think? and What should I say to him to get him to offer me  a really good high paying job

**Considering job advice**

Hmm, it looks like the user's asking how to get a good job offer from Tom Dotson after their interview. He seems somewhat responsive but also involved in some interactions with quite a few people. It's good that he asked the user to follow up. Now, what should the user say? Maybe they should express gratitude, show enthusiasm for the role, and reinforce why they're a great fit. Something clear, professional, but confident could be key. Let's think about wording that is polite, yet persuasive!

**Advising on job negotiation**

The candidate seems eager, but calling multiple times could be seen as too pushy. Still, it’s promising that the owner returned the call and requested a text reminder. It seems like a good opportunity to reaffirm enthusiasm and professionalism. For the text, I’d recommend something like: “Hi Tom, it's [Your Name]. Just confirming I'll be available at 7 as requested. Looking forward to our discussion." This shows preparation, eagerness, and respect for his time. Keep it polite and calm!

**Negotiating for a high-paying job**

To negotiate a high-paying job, focus on presenting yourself as a solution provider. Highlight your achievements and how they align with the company's needs. Instead of directly discussing salary, first ask insightful questions about responsibilities and the compensation package. Stay professional, polite, and concise in your communication. For the text, I’d suggest something like: “Hi Tom, it’s [Your Name]. I’m confirming I’ll be available as requested and I look forward to discussing how I can contribute to Great Resort Vacations.” Keep the tone friendly but professional!

Your situation suggests that while you're eager—and rightly so—it’s important to balance your enthusiasm with professionalism. Here are some ideas on how to handle the text and the subsequent conversation:

---

### 1. Crafting the Text Message

Since he asked you to text him about 20 minutes before 7, keep your message clear, polite, and professional. You want to confirm your availability and express your continued interest without coming on too strong. For example:

> **"Hello Tom, this is [Your Name]. I’m confirming that I’ll be here at 6:40 to talk, as we discussed. I’m really excited about the opportunity at Great Resort Vacations and look forward to our conversation. Thank you!"**

This message:
- **Confirms your commitment:** It verifies that you’re following his instructions.
- **Shows enthusiasm:** You mention your excitement about the opportunity, which reinforces your interest.
- **Maintains professionalism:** It’s succinct and respectful.

---

### 2. Preparing for the Call

When you eventually speak with him, this is your moment to reinforce why you’re the ideal candidate for a high-impact, high-paying role. Here are some strategies:

#### **a. Emphasize Your Value**
- **Highlight Achievements:** Briefly mention past successes relevant to the role. For instance, if you have experience increasing revenue, improving operations, or leading projects, outline these achievements quantitatively.
- **Tailor Your Pitch:** Connect your experiences to the needs of Great Resort Vacations. Explain how your skills can solve particular problems or drive growth for them.

#### **b. Demonstrate Industry and Company Insight**
- **Ask Informed Questions:** Inquire about key priorities at the company, upcoming projects, or the qualities they value most in a leader. This shows you’re thinking strategically and are genuinely interested.
- **Speak Their Language:** Use terminology or references that resonate with the company’s business, especially if it relates to luxury vacations, customer service excellence, or business growth.

#### **c. Approach Salary Discussions Tactfully**
- **Wait for the Right Moment:** Initially focus on demonstrating your fit for the role before directly discussing compensation.
- **Frame Your Worth:** When the topic comes up, you might say something like,  
  > *"Based on my track record and the value I plan to bring in terms of [specific example, e.g., revenue growth, operational efficiency], I’m confident that we can agree on a compensation package that reflects both the responsibilities and the impact I’m ready to deliver."*  
  This approach reinforces your value without coming off as too focused solely on the money.

#### **d. Convey Confidence and Readiness**
- **Practice Your Pitch:** Ensure your key points about your contributions, relevant experiences, and vision for the role are well-rehearsed but delivered naturally.
- **Be Ready for Follow-Ups:** Have a few examples of how you’ve navigated challenges or led successful initiatives ready, so you’re prepared if he asks for more detail.

---

### 3. Balancing Enthusiasm and Patience

It’s great that you’ve followed up persistently, but remember that a few follow-up calls or texts are enough to show genuine interest. Now that he’s requested a text and set a time, use that as your opportunity to shine rather than trying to overcompensate for the earlier follow-ups.

- **Stay Positive:** Avoid apologizing excessively for the earlier calls; instead, focus on being proactive and respectful of his time.
- **Follow His Cues:** Let the tone of the call guide your conversation. If he seems open to discussing the role further, it might be the time to outline your vision and ask about details of the compensation structure later in the conversation.

### Final Thoughts

The key is to show him you’re a high-caliber professional who knows their worth, but also understands how to communicate effectively and respectfully. By confirming the call with a well-crafted text and preparing a succinct, value-driven pitch for when you speak, you’ll be positioning yourself as a candidate who’s not just looking for any job, but the right opportunity where your contributions—and compensation—reflect your true potential.

Good luck on your call!

What would I say to him to let him know that I will do ANYTHING to work with him and be succesful and help him continue to be succesful and he will gain a trusted friend in the process

**Crafting thoughtful communication**

The user asks how to express dedication to a potential collaborator, emphasizing enthusiasm, creativity, and respect. I need to avoid sounding desperate yet still show willingness to do whatever it takes. The phrase "anything" should be used with care, being enthusiastic without overdoing it. I’ll suggest ideas for how the user might convey their desire to work together successfully, ensuring their tone is positive, supportive, and encouraging, while maintaining a sense of respect and professionalism.

**Crafting a professional message**

I need to help the user craft a message that conveys dedication and willingness to go above and beyond, while being careful not to sound desperate. Phrases like "I'll do anything" can be seen as too much, so I'll suggest more balanced alternatives like "I am fully committed" or "I’m prepared to do whatever it takes," while still expressing eagerness. I’ll emphasize authenticity and professionalism—no hyperbole, but still showing trust, enthusiasm, and a commitment to mutual success. It's important the message sounds genuine and matches the context.

Below is an example of how you might express that level of commitment while still sounding professional, sincere, and enthusiastic. The key is to balance strong dedication with a clear articulation of how your talents and energy will directly benefit him and the company, without sounding overly desperate or vague. Tailor your tone to match his style and the conversation's context.

### Sample Script

> **"Hi Tom, I really appreciate this opportunity and your willingness to connect today. I want you to know that I’m completely committed to Great Resort Vacations—I’m ready to put in every effort, take on any challenge, and go above and beyond to not only help maintain but to drive even greater success for the company. I see working with you as more than just a job; it’s a chance to build a trusted partnership where our goals and successes are closely aligned. I’m excited to contribute my skills, energy, and passion to ensure that our shared vision comes to life."**

### What This Script Does

1. **Shows Gratitude and Respect:**  
   - Starting with appreciation sets a positive tone.
   - It reassures him that you’re respectful of his time and leadership.

2. **Communicates Total Commitment:**  
   - Phrases like “completely committed” and “ready to put in every effort” indicate that you’re prepared to invest your energy and skills fully.
   - Emphasize that you’re prepared to face any challenges and are willing to do what it takes to succeed.

3. **Focuses on Partnership and Mutual Success:**  
   - By stating that you see this opportunity as a chance to build a "trusted partnership," you shift from being just another employee to becoming a committed ally in his continued success.
   - This language conveys that you are interested in a genuine, long-term professional relationship.

4. **Aligns Your Skills and Vision with the Company’s Goals:**  
   - You mention that your skills, energy, and passion will directly contribute to bringing the vision to life.
   - This demonstrates that your commitment is strategic and tied to measurable success, not just a personal promise to “do anything.”

### Additional Tips

- **Be Genuine and Specific:**  
  While “I’ll do anything” sounds bold, it’s often more effective when you back up that enthusiasm with specifics about how your expertise or past experiences are relevant. If you have real examples of challenges you’ve overcome or successes you’ve driven in previous roles, be prepared to mention them briefly if the conversation steers in that direction.

- **Mind the Timing:**  
  Use this message as a foundation, but be ready to adjust based on his responses. If he asks for more specifics or dives into particular company challenges, you might tailor your examples to show that you’ve already thought about how to tackle them.

- **Stay Confident Without Overpromising:**  
  Expressing your readiness to “do anything” should come with the caveat that it’s your passion and your expertise that will help make it happen. Confidence is key, but it’s also important to leave room for collaboration and realistic goal-setting.

Using language like the sample script above communicates that you’re not just eager but also thoughtfully committed to driving results and fostering a strong, mutually beneficial working relationship. Good luck, and let your passion and professionalism shine through!
