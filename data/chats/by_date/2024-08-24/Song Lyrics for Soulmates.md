Summary: ---

**Verse 1**  
In a smoky bar downtown, under neon lights  
Two lost souls found each other on a Friday night  
Eyes met, hearts aligned, in that fleeting glow  
Both had secrets buried deep, that nobody could know  

**Chorus**  
We were soulmates in a world gone wrong  
Found our strength where we didn't belong  
Through the highs and lows, we kept each other alive  
But sometimes love can't help you survive  

**Verse 2**  
Through the shadows of our past, we held on tight  
Saved each other from the darkness, every single night  
We danced on the edge of a razor-thin line  
Two hearts beating fast, always running out of time  

**Bridge**  
We saw the sunrise in the darkest of places  
Held each other close, through the cold and the faces  
But the weight of the world, it was just too much  
One slipped away, couldn’t stay in touch  

**Chorus**  
We were soulmates in a world gone wrong  
Found our strength where we didn't belong  
Through the highs and lows, we kept each other alive  
But sometimes love can't help you survive  

**Verse 3**  
One fell back to the arms of a ruthless vice  
The other left wondering, what was the price  
Of loving someone who's lost in their pain  
But love and loss, they are one and the same  

**Outro**  
Now I walk these empty streets alone  
Remembering the life we used to own  
You’re in every shadow, every city light  
Two souls that danced once in the dead of night  

**Chorus**  
We were soulmates in a world gone wrong  
Found our strength where we didn't belong  
Through the highs and lows, we kept each other alive  
But sometimes love can't help you survive  

**End**  
And though you're gone, I still carry on  
In every beat of this broken song
