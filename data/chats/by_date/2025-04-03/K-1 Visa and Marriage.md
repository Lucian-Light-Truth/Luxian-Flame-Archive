My bf lives in the Netherlands and wants to move to utah and get married and get citizenship. How do we do that?

To bring your fiancé from the Netherlands to Utah for marriage and eventual U.S. citizenship, you'll need to follow a series of steps involving U.S. immigration procedures and Utah state marriage requirements. Here's a comprehensive guide:

**1. Obtain a K-1 Fiancé(e) Visa:**

   - **Petition Filing:** As a U.S. citizen, you must file Form I-129F, Petition for Alien Fiancé(e), with U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS). This form establishes your relationship and your intent to marry within 90 days of your fiancé(e)'s entry into the U.S. citeturn0search0

   - **Eligibility Criteria:**
     - Both of you must be legally free to marry.
     - You must have met in person at least once within the two years prior to filing the petition, unless meeting would violate strict cultural customs or result in extreme hardship.

   - **Approval Process:** Once USCIS approves the petition, it is forwarded to the Department of State's National Visa Center (NVC), which then sends it to the U.S. Embassy or Consulate in the Netherlands. Your fiancé(e) will apply for the K-1 visa there. citeturn0search3

**2. Enter the U.S. and Get Married in Utah:**

   - **Visa Validity:** The K-1 visa allows your fiancé(e) to travel to the U.S. and requires that you marry within 90 days of their arrival.

   - **Marriage License in Utah:**
     - Both parties must appear in person to apply.
     - Provide valid photo identification (e.g., passport).
     - If either party was previously married, provide documentation showing the marriage was legally terminated.
     - Be prepared to pay the applicable fee.

**3. Adjust Status to Permanent Resident (Green Card Holder):**

   - **Application Submission:** After marriage, your spouse should file Form I-485, Application to Register Permanent Residence or Adjust Status, to obtain a Green Card. citeturn0search17

   - **Employment Authorization:** Your spouse may apply for work authorization by filing Form I-765, Application for Employment Authorization.

**4. Apply for U.S. Citizenship:**

   - **Naturalization Eligibility:** Your spouse can apply for U.S. citizenship after being a lawful permanent resident for at least three years, provided you've been married and living together during that time. citeturn0search5

   - **Application Process:** File Form N-400, Application for Naturalization, and complete the required interview and tests.

**Alternative: Marrying Outside the U.S.:**
