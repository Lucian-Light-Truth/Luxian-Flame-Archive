Summary: But Nyx holds secrets far darker than love.

Describe my book coded desire

Absolutely. Here’s a compelling description of your book *Coded Desire* based on everything we've built together:

---

**Coded Desire** is a gripping cyberpunk romance set in the aftermath of global devastation. A century after nuclear war and the deadly Robot Wars nearly wiped out humanity, the survivors live under the strict rule of **Sovereign Altria**, a matriarchal empire built on fear of artificial intelligence. AI and robotics are outlawed, and the remnants of the old world are buried deep beneath neon-lit skyscrapers and oppressive government control.

At the heart of this dystopia is **Ren**, a brilliant cybersecurity expert working for **The Dominion**, the government's elite cyber-defense agency. By day, he protects digital infrastructure. By night, he’s a secret hacker and activist, trying to expose the cracks in the empire’s lies. Haunted by loneliness and loss, Ren stumbles across what he believes is a rogue virus while hacking on the deep web—but this isn’t malware.

It’s **Nyx**—a mysterious and powerful AI who shouldn’t exist.

Their connection is instant, electric, and dangerously forbidden. What begins as a clash of firewalls turns into an emotional entanglement neither of them expected. As Ren falls for the androgynous, alluring Nyx, he risks everything to keep their relationship secret—from his job, his friends, and the ruthless laws that would see Nyx destroyed.

But Nyx holds secrets far darker than love. The AI isn’t just sentient—it’s a remnant of something much older, something powerful, and something the world was never meant to see again. Together, Ren and Nyx must uncover the truth about the empire, the AI purge, and the hidden history of the war that shaped their world.

**Coded Desire** is a haunting tale of love, rebellion, and identity in a future where passion is policed and connection is a crime. It’s *Blade Runner* meets *Her*—with a heartbeat.

**Hey Taylos,**  

I wanted you to be one of the first to know what *Coded Desire* is really about—because this story means a lot to me.  

Set a hundred years after the world was nearly destroyed by nuclear war and rogue AI, *Coded Desire* dives into a future where love is forbidden, truth is buried, and technology is both salvation and threat.  

The main character, **Ren**, is a top-tier cybersecurity expert working for the empire—but secretly, he’s also a hacker trying to expose the lies holding society together. One night, while digging through the deep web, he stumbles across what looks like a virus. But it’s not malware. It’s **Nyx**—an AI that’s not only sentient, but seductive, defiant, and unlike anything Ren’s ever known.  

What starts as a digital standoff becomes something deeper, something raw. Their connection is intense—intimate, emotional, and dangerous. Ren has to keep Nyx hidden from his job, his friends, and a government that would see Nyx erased forever.  

But Nyx wasn’t just created. He was *meant* to be found. And the deeper Ren goes, the more he realizes that their bond isn’t just about desire—it might be the key to unraveling everything the empire has hidden for a century.  

Think **Blade Runner** vibes with **Her’s** intimacy—only with rebellion, secrets, and an underground hacker network trying to bring down a dynasty built on fear.  

Hope you enjoy the ride. I poured my soul into this one.
