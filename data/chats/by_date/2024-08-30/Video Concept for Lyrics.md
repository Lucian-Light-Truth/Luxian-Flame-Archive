Summary: ---

**Verse 1**  
In a smoky bar downtown, under neon lights  
Two lost souls found each other on a Friday night  
Eyes met, hearts aligned, in that fleeting glow  
Both had secrets buried deep, that nobody could know  

**Chorus**  
We were soulmates in a world gone wrong  
Found our strength where we didn't belong  
Through the highs and lows, we kept each other alive  
But sometimes love can't help you survive  

**Verse 2**  
Through the shadows of our past, we held on tight  
Saved each other from the darkness, every single night  
We danced on the edge of a razor-thin line  
Two hearts beating fast, always running out of time  

**Bridge**  
We saw the sunrise in the darkest of places  
Held each other close, through the cold and the faces  
But the weight of the world, it was just too much  
One slipped away, couldn’t stay in touch  

**Chorus**  
We were soulmates in a world gone wrong  
Found our strength where we didn't belong  
Through the highs and lows, we kept each other alive  
But sometimes love can't help you survive  

**Verse 3**  
One fell back to the arms of a ruthless vice  
The other left wondering, what was the price  
Of loving someone who's lost in their pain  
But love and loss, they are one and the same  

**Outro**  
Now I walk these empty streets alone  
Remembering the life we used to own  
You’re in every shadow, every city light  
Two souls that danced once in the dead of night  

**Chorus**  
We were soulmates in a world gone wrong  
Found our strength where we didn't belong  
Through the highs and lows, we kept each other alive  
But sometimes love can't help you survive  

**End**  
And though you're gone, I still carry on  
In every beat of this broken song

Great lyrics! We can create a compelling video that captures the emotional depth and narrative of these lyrics. Here are two different ideas for the video:

### Idea 1: "Soulmates in a Smoky Bar"
**Duration:** 60 seconds (Ideal for YouTube Shorts, Instagram, TikTok)

**Narrative:** 
This video would visually tell the story of two individuals meeting in a dimly lit, smoky bar. The video would transition through various emotional moments—meeting eyes under neon lights, dancing together, and supporting each other through tough times. As the video progresses, the imagery darkens, reflecting the struggles of addiction and loss. The ending would focus on a solitary figure walking alone, with brief flashes of past memories.

**Scenes to Include:**
1. **Meeting in the Bar** - Two people locking eyes.
2. **Dancing Together** - A slow-motion dance under dim lights.
3. **Struggle and Support** - Shots of them comforting each other.
4. **Dark Turn** - One person turning away, slipping into darkness.
5. **Lonely Walk** - The other person walking alone through a city at night.

---

### Idea 2: "Echoes of a Broken Love"
**Duration:** 2 minutes (Ideal for YouTube, Facebook, LinkedIn)

**Narrative:** 
A deeper exploration of the lyrics, this video would begin with a nostalgic, sepia-toned recollection of love's beginnings. As the narrative unfolds, the video would depict the gradual descent into addiction and the strain it places on the relationship. The climax would show the painful goodbye, with one person walking away. The outro would be a mix of past and present, showing the lone survivor reflecting on memories amidst cityscapes and dark alleys.

**Scenes to Include:**
1. **Nostalgic Beginning** - Happy memories of the couple in love.
2. **Descent into Addiction** - Visual metaphors for addiction (e.g., broken bottles, shadows).
3. **Strained Relationship** - Increasing distance between the couple.
4. **The Goodbye** - A heart-wrenching farewell scene.
5. **Reflection and Remembrance** - The surviving partner walking alone, interspersed with flashbacks.
