What does Chat GPT Plus do?

ChatGPT Plus is a subscription plan offered by OpenAI that provides several benefits over the free version of ChatGPT. Some of the main features of ChatGPT Plus include:

1. **Access to GPT-4**: Plus users have access to GPT-4, which is a more advanced version of the AI model compared to the GPT-3.5 model available to free users. This can result in more accurate and nuanced responses.

2. **Faster Response Times**: Plus subscribers generally experience faster response times, especially during peak usage times when the system may be slower for free users.

3. **Priority Access**: Plus users receive priority access to the service, which means they are less likely to experience downtime or be put on a waiting list during high-traffic periods.

The ChatGPT Plus plan costs $20 per month.
