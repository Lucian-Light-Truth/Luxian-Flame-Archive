**🚀 How to Create a Crypto Wallet (Universal Access Guide)**

Hey! 👋 Here’s a simple step-by-step guide to help you create your own **crypto wallet** so you can access your funds from anywhere:

---

### 🛠️ Step 1: Choose Your Wallet Type  
You have two main options:

1. **Mobile/Desktop Wallet** (Easy to use):  
   - Examples: **Trust Wallet**, **MetaMask**, **Coinbase Wallet**

2. **Hardware Wallet** (Most secure, physical device):  
   - Examples: **Ledger**, **Trezor**

If you're just starting out, go with **Trust Wallet** or **MetaMask**.

---

### 📲 Step 2: Download the Wallet App  
- Go to the **App Store** (iOS) or **Google Play** (Android)  
- Search and download:  
  - 🟣 **Trust Wallet**: [https://trustwallet.com](https://trustwallet.com)  
  - 🦊 **MetaMask**: [https://metamask.io](https://metamask.io)

---

### 🧠 Step 3: Create a New Wallet  
- Open the app and tap **“Create New Wallet”**  
- You’ll be given a **Secret Recovery Phrase (12 or 24 words)**  
- **WRITE IT DOWN** and store it safely — *this is the key to your wallet*  
  - 📵 Never share this phrase  
  - 🗝 If you lose it, you lose access to your funds

---

### 🔐 Step 4: Set a Passcode  
- Set a strong PIN or biometric lock (face/fingerprint)  
- This keeps your wallet safe from others using your device

---

### 💸 Step 5: Add Crypto Funds  
- Tap **“Receive”** to copy your wallet address (starts with `0x...` for Ethereum)  
- You can send crypto here from an exchange like **Coinbase**, **Binance**, or **Cash App (for Bitcoin)**

---

### 🌍 Step 6: Universal Access Tips  
- You can **recover your wallet** on *any* device using your **Secret Phrase**  
- Just download the app and tap **“Import Wallet”**  
- Enter your phrase — your funds will appear, no matter where you are
