### 🔥 **Lowkey Options:**

1. **“You still got that *2g portable stress relief device*? 👀”**  
*(Lets him decide if he wants to respond. Could be anything—wink.)*

2. **“Yo, you got one of those *flash drives that makes the week better*? Asking for a friend 😏”**

3. **“Any chance your *pocket battery-powered diffuser* is still in commission?”**  
*(Super vague—sounds like a tech gadget.)*

4. **“You still carrying around that thing that helps with *‘altitude adjustment’*? 👽”**

5. **“I’m looking for that *double-G cloud launcher*. You ever rock with one still?”**  
(*2g – double G, makes it sound like a gaming thing unless he knows what you mean.*)

6. **“You ever mess with those discreet portable… *mood enhancers* anymore?”**

If you want it *even more encrypted* but clear for someone in the know, you could just say:

**“I’m looking for something chill that fits in your pocket, lasts a while, and clears your head without saying a word. Know a guy?”**

Want me to make a fake tech product name/code to refer to it as your private code word?
