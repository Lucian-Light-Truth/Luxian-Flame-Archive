If your home's A/C isn‚Äôt keeping the house cool, it might just need a good cleaning. Here's a step-by-step **DIY guide to clean your home‚Äôs central air conditioning system**, especially during hot Utah summers:

---

### üîß **WHAT YOU'LL NEED**
- Screwdriver
- Vacuum with hose attachment
- Garden hose
- Fin comb (optional)
- Spray bottle with water + mild dish soap
- Clean microfiber cloth or soft brush
- Replacement air filter (if needed)
- Gloves + mask (optional, for dust protection)

---

## üåÄ STEP-BY-STEP A/C CLEANING GUIDE

### 1. **Turn off the Power**
> Shut off the unit at the thermostat and breaker to stay safe.

---

### 2. **Clean the Indoor Unit (Evaporator Coil)**
> Usually located inside your furnace or air handler.

- **Open the access panel** (may require a screwdriver).
- **Vacuum visible dust** around the coil gently.
- Spray **coil-safe cleaner** or use mild soap + water spray. Let sit for 5‚Äì10 minutes.
- Wipe clean or let it evaporate naturally.
- **Check the drain pan and drain line**‚Äîclear any gunk with vinegar or bleach solution.

---

### 3. **Replace or Clean the Air Filter**
> Clogged filters are a top reason for poor cooling.

- Replace if it looks gray, dusty, or hasn‚Äôt been changed in 1‚Äì3 months.
- Write the date of replacement on the new filter.

---

### 4. **Clean the Outdoor Unit (Condenser)**
> This is the big box outside your home.

- **Remove debris**: Clear leaves, grass, or dirt from around the unit.
- **Turn off the power at the outside disconnect**.
- Unscrew the top grille and carefully lift the fan without disconnecting wires.
- Vacuum or spray out debris from inside.
- Use a **garden hose (not pressure washer)** to spray the coils from inside out.
- Spray soapy water on fins, then rinse again.
- Gently straighten bent fins with a **fin comb**.

---

### 5. **Restore Power & Test the Unit**
> After everything dries (especially outside unit), turn power back on.
- Run your A/C and monitor if cool air is coming out strong.
- If it‚Äôs still struggling, it may need refrigerant or a technician‚Äôs inspection.

---

## ‚úÖ EXTRA TIPS:
- **Shade your outdoor unit** (not block!) for efficiency.
- **Use ceiling fans** to assist airflow inside.
- **Insulate your attic or windows** to prevent heat buildup.
- Clean A/C at least once a year, ideally before summer.
