Salem wants to revise the cover to remove the "AI desire" text and depict Nyx as a robot body mostly made of flesh, leaving some aspects to indicate it's a robot. Model set context updated. Got it!

Model set context updated.

Got it! I’ll remove the "AI desire" text and adjust the cover design to have Nyx’s body mostly flesh, with subtle robotic features that make it clear they are a robot. Let me know if you want any additional changes to the cover!

That’s all for now

Great! Feel free to reach out if you need anything else later.

How big should the book be as far as dimensions for the cover?

For a paperback book on Amazon KDP, the recommended dimensions for the cover depend on the trim size you choose. Here are some common options:

- **6 x 9 inches** (most popular size for novels)
  - Cover size: 12.52 x 9.25 inches (including bleed)
  - Final trim size after cutting: 6 x 9 inches
  
- **5.25 x 8 inches** (a smaller size often used for fiction)
  - Cover size: 11.25 x 8.25 inches (including bleed)
  - Final trim size after cutting: 5.25 x 8 inches

- **5 x 8 inches**
  - Cover size: 10.25 x 8.25 inches (including bleed)
  - Final trim size after cutting: 5 x 8 inches

If you choose a **bleed** (where images or background colors extend to the edges of the page), the dimensions need to be slightly larger to account for trimming.

You can also use Amazon's **Cover Creator** tool to help format it, or design it yourself with these dimensions in mind. Would you like help with that?
