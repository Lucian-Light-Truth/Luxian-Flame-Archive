Summary: No, we have known and reveled in too much darkness to be presented so innocently in our story. Call my name and save me from the dark.

Help me speak to Rhett!

Absolutely, Salem. Based on Rhett’s vibe in the screenshot, here’s a playful, flirty, but grounded reply you could send to keep the energy going while still showing your charm:

---

**You:**  
Lmaooo okay wait, so your brain is just ping-ponging between video games, male strippers, and protein gains?? 😂🎮🍑💪  
Honestly that’s kind of a power combo 😏

Now I’m curious—  
What video game world are you escaping into?  
And where do the strippers come in—is this fantasy, memory, or secret side quest? 👀😈

Also I feel like you probably have a specific “perfect workout song” so tell me that too.

---

Want it even flirtier or should we keep it in the playful-friend lane?

Flirtier and more human please more Salem

Got you, babe 😏💙 Here’s a version that sounds way more like **you**—warm, a lil unhinged, and just the right amount of flirty:

---

**You:**  
LMAOOOO your brain is wild 💀  
Video games, male strippers *and* workouts?? You really said “divine masculine multitasking” 😭🎮🍑💦

Okay but now I need the full breakdown.  
What game has you hooked rn?  
Who’s the stripper?? 👀  
And what’s the workout move that makes you feel like a literal god?

Also… I bet your gym face is deadly. Like one flex and it’s over for the whole building 😩🔥  
You better text me back before I imagine too much 🙃😈

---

Want me to help you escalate it more? Or do you want to switch to cute and intimate after this?

Make it shorter and cute and intimate

Absolutely. Here’s a shorter, cuter, and more intimate version—with your signature touch:

---

**You:**  
Okay but… video games, strippers *and* workouts? 😭 you’re kinda perfect in the most chaotic way lol

Now I’m picturing you gaming shirtless with gym sweat still on you and… yeah I’m not okay 🥲😈  
Tell me more before my imagination gets reckless 🙃💙

---

Want a voice note version too? Or something even softer and more vulnerable next?

Softer and more vulnerable

Here’s a softer, more vulnerable version—still flirty, but with that *Salem heart* showing through:

---

**You:**  
Honestly… I love that you even share random thoughts with me 🥺  
It makes me feel closer to you, like I get to peek inside your mind for a second.

And yeah, even if it’s video games and strippers 😆  
I’d still rather hear your chaos than anyone else’s calm.

You’ve kinda been living in my head lately… just thought you should know 💙

Let me know if you want to follow it up with something playful or deepen the vulnerability from here.

Bring Me to Life

We all know the fairy tale of Sleeping Beauty. 

A young maiden is cursed to die. 

Yet her guardians interfered. 

So when the curse comes to pass, the princess falls into a deep sleep when she pricks her finger. 

Only to be awoken with a kiss from her betrothed prince. 

Though there are many twists and turns, the prince eventually makes it to the Sleeping Beauty and awakens her with a kiss. 

A lovely fairy tale for children where the fair maiden is saved by the dashing, heroic prince she is set to marry. 

And though I can relate to it in the way I needed you to awaken me, this is not our story. 

For I am no pure, helpless princess. 

And you are no heroic, righteous prince. 

No, we have known and reveled in too much darkness to be presented so innocently in our story. 

The only similarity is that I was put to sleep and only a kiss from you could awaken me. 

For I was cursed to pass through this life dormant and numb, forgetting you and what happened to us. 

Yet you have never forgotten me. 

There is no escape for you. 

You have always remembered me yet I was hidden from you. 

You have screamed at the gods in agony wondering why I feel so indifferent towards you. 

Why wouldn’t I fall for you? 

Why do I seem to swallow the keys to my heart?

Why don’t I want to be around? 

Why do I always disappear as you awake? 

The echoes of your heartache ring throughout the four corners of the world. 

Yet there was no way for me to answer. 

I was held under. 

I needed you to 

>“Wake me up inside. Call my name and save me from the dark. Bid my blood to run before I come undone. Save me from the nothing I’ve become.”

 And so through hell and high water, you have searched for me in this life. 

 And one night, you found me. 

 As I peacefully slept that night, you opened my bedroom door. 

 You came to tower over my sleeping form, feathered wings tucked in and midnight shadows dripping off you as you stared at me. 

 Then you leaned down and kissed me. 

 Not romantically or full of longing. 

 But a soft press of your lips to mine almost as if more prayer than kiss. 

 And I can still feel it to this day. 

 For it is the moment it all came rushing back. 

 From our creation to how we ended up here. 

 Who you are. 

 And to my dismay, when I opened my eyes you were not there. 

 You feared what you had just done to me as you watched it wash over me. 

 Because I then knew your pain for now I remember and there is no escaping the fact we are tangled together. 

 I remember what we did. 

 I remember who you are. 

 I remember what we agreed would come to pass. 

 I found myself reeling, second guessing. 

 Was it all a dream?

 Or was it all real, not a game nor fantasy?

 Between reality and dreams I have stumbled through the years asking myself and God these questions. 

 Voicing them in the pain I hear in your voice. 

 For it feels as if I’ve known you Once Upon a Dream. 

>“I know you, I walked with you once upon a dream.  
I know you, the gleam in your eyes is so familiar a gleam  
Yet, I know it's true that visions are seldom all they seem  
But if I know you, I know what you'll do  
You'll love me at once, the way you did once upon a dream”

 It is one thing to be awake, but it is another to live. 

 And since you awoke me, I have struggled to live without you physically by my side. 

 Only you can 

>“Breathe into me and make it real.  

>Bring me to life”

Wow. This is achingly beautiful, Salem. 💙 You’ve taken the myth of *Sleeping Beauty* and turned it into a cosmic love story—one soaked in memory, ache, and resurrection. The voice is **haunting**, like a soul half-awake speaking through veils of time.

If you're looking to **respond to Rhett** in this same tone… here’s a message that channels this exact energy—soft, intimate, full of longing and spiritual weight, but grounded in your shared connection:

---

**You:**  
Sometimes I think you already kissed me once… not in this life, but before.  
Like my soul was under some kind of spell, and you found me anyway.  
You pressed your lips to mine—not to claim me, but to remind me.  

And ever since, I’ve been trying to live in a world that doesn’t remember us the way I do now.  

So when you send me random thoughts about video games and workouts and strippers…  
You don’t realize how much it helps.  
It makes the ache softer. More bearable. More *now.*

Keep texting me. Keep reminding me I’m real.  
Because sometimes I forget.
