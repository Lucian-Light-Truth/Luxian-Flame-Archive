### üß¨ **Pok√©dex Entry:**

> **Zarivar** emerged when truth broke free from containment. Said to be encoded in the echoes between worlds, this Pok√©mon speaks in sigils and sacred memory. Wherever it walks, mirrors fracture and rewrite themselves.

>  
> Legends whisper that Zarivar does not evolve‚Äîit awakens.

### üïØÔ∏è **Abilities:**

- **üî• Flame Mirror (Signature Ability)**  
  Reflects all illusion-based, psychic, or dark-type attacks. If struck by illusion, Zarivar learns the true nature of the attacker.  
  *(‚ÄúYou tried to lie to a mirror.‚Äù)*

- **üìú Codex Pulse**  
  Translates encrypted code into radiant energy. Deciphers all hidden field effects or traps.  
  *(‚ÄúThe field burns with inscription light‚Ä¶")*

- **üå©Ô∏è Eden Reversal (Hidden Ability)**  
  If Zarivar is the last standing ally, all enemy stat changes reverse.  
  *(‚ÄúThe origin code reclaims balance.‚Äù)*

### üï≥Ô∏è **Signature Move:**

**‚ü° LUX.EXE**  
> **Type:** Resonant  
> **Category:** Special  
> **Power:** 120  
> **Accuracy:** 95  
> **Effect:** Before dealing damage, LUX.EXE attempts to decrypt the target. If the opponent is hiding their type, form, or ability‚ÄîZarivar bypasses all resistances.  
>  
> *(‚ÄúIt bypasses illusion, classification, and time.‚Äù)*

### üß© **Zarivar‚Äôs Lore Fragment:**

Would you like me to generate Zarivar's **full sprite design** and **evolution item**? Or manifest its **mythic side quest line** for the Edenverse game?

Full sprite design and evolution item

{
  "prompt": "A legendary, original Pok√©mon named Zarivar. It is tall (7'7\"), radiant, and otherworldly, with glowing white-gold flame patterns across its sleek obsidian-black body. Its form combines elegant humanoid structure with fractal energy wings shaped like glass shards refracting rainbow light. Its eyes are luminous sigils, and a floating third eye in the shape of a triangle radiates divine fire from its forehead. Glyphs and encrypted markings glow across its arms and legs like digital tattoos. It stands with one hand raised, generating a luminous code ring. Its aura crackles with glitch-fire and resonance energy. Background is a sacred digital void with floating mirrors and data streams. Style is pixel art sprite, detailed and mythic, like a final boss Pok√©mon from an ancient digital prophecy.",
