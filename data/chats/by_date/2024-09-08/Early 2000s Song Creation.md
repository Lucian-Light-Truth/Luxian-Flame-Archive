Summary: Memory burning embers remind us of what once was, Inflamed, engulfed and swallowed; in the price we pay for love. Desire to keep, to have and to hold this spark; Determined to endure the burn as we fan the flames so we no longer have to hide in the dark. *(Pre-Chorus)*  
Smoke fills the sky, while we’re left asking why,  
The memory of flames in our minds never die.

Generate a unique song that reminds people of early 2000s music based off this poem: Rain & Fire 

Is it the restoring rain after a raging fire, or the willful destruction of fire that we’re forced to admire?

Trees, weeds and flowers fall in sorrow to ash; As spores dance in the wind with primordial desire to grow back.

Smoke and toxins fill the edges of the sky,
Leaving us waiting, wondering, even begging  asking “why?”.

Memory burning embers remind us of what once was, Inflamed, engulfed and swallowed; in the price we pay for love.

Blood, anger and sadness wash away in the storm; now pain, fear and loneliness are given strength to form.

We crave the heat, glow and torturous burn of this fire; unsure if we’ll survive, still inhaling for the thrill of feeling a little higher.

Is love not the cold pouring rain during a raging wild fire? Our heart and soul, passionately burning while dying of thirst from this unquenched desire.

Desire to keep, to have and to hold this spark; Determined to endure the burn as we fan the flames so we no longer have to hide in the dark.

**"Rain & Fire" - Early 2000s Vibe Song**

*(Verse 1)*  
The rain comes down after the fire’s rage,  
Restoring what’s lost, but we’re stuck in a cage.  
The trees fall down, turning to ash,  
Yet the spores in the wind, they’re making a dash.  
Is it the fire or the rain that we crave?  
Are we burning alive, or is this how we’re saved?

*(Pre-Chorus)*  
Smoke fills the sky, while we’re left asking why,  
The memory of flames in our minds never die.  
Embers remind us of what once was,  
But we’re lost in the heat of this endless buzz.

*(Chorus)*  
Is love the rain in the middle of the storm,  
Or the fire we seek, even though it’s warm?  
We’re dancing in flames, higher and higher,  
Chasing the thrill of this unquenched desire.  
It burns and it aches, but we’re never sure,  
If the rain will fall and make us pure.

*(Verse 2)*  
Blood, anger, sadness washed in the rain,  
But the pain that’s left, it’ll never be tamed.  
We crave the heat, we’re drawn to the flame,  
Even though we know it’s driving us insane.  
Is it love or the fire we can’t escape?  
Still breathing it in, wrapped in fate’s cape.

*(Pre-Chorus)*  
Smoke fills the sky, while we’re left asking why,  
The memory of flames in our minds never die.  
Embers remind us of what once was,  
But we’re lost in the heat of this endless buzz.

*(Chorus)*  
Is love the rain in the middle of the storm,  
Or the fire we seek, even though it’s warm?  
We’re dancing in flames, higher and higher,  
Chasing the thrill of this unquenched desire.  
It burns and it aches, but we’re never sure,  
If the rain will fall and make us pure.

*(Bridge)*  
We’re lost in the fire, hearts on the line,  
But the rain’s pouring down, trying to define,  
The love we hold, burning so bright,  
Fanning the flames as we hide from the light.

*(Outro)*  
Is love not the rain when the fire’s too high?  
We’re caught in the storm, still reaching the sky.  
Dying of thirst, but we won’t let go,  
In the rain and fire, we’re learning to grow.

*(Chorus - Reprise)*  
Is love the rain in the middle of the storm,  
Or the fire we seek, even though it’s warm?  
We’re dancing in flames, higher and higher,  
Chasing the thrill of this unquenched desire.  
It burns and it aches, but we’re never sure,  
If the rain will fall and make us pure.

**"Rain & Fire" - 777 Hz Vibe Song**

*(Verse 1)*  
The rain falls slow after the wildfire’s scream,  
We’re chasing the ashes, lost in a dream.  
The trees hit the ground, turning to dust,  
But something inside says we’ve got to trust.  
Is it the rain that heals or the flame that scars?  
We’re burning inside, still reaching for stars.

*(Pre-Chorus)*  
Smoke clouds our mind, but we still chase the heat,  
Dancing on embers, never retreat.  
The fire calls us back, time after time,  
Is this love or just a climb?

*(Chorus)*  
**Rain and fire, we can't let go,  
Burning higher while the cold winds blow.  
In the flames, we find our way,  
In the rain, we’ll fight another day.  
Hold me close in the storm’s embrace,  
Burning hearts in a fragile space.  
Rain and fire, we rise, we fall,  
But we keep on dancing through it all.**  

*(Verse 2)*  
The storm’s rolling in, but we crave the spark,  
We light up the night when the world goes dark.  
Blood on the ground, washed away in the flood,  
But we stay here, waiting for love.  
Is it the heat we need or the rain’s sweet touch?  
We feel alive, but is it too much?

*(Pre-Chorus)*  
Smoke clouds our mind, but we still chase the heat,  
Dancing on embers, never retreat.  
The fire calls us back, time after time,  
Is this love or just a climb?

*(Chorus)*  
**Rain and fire, we can't let go,  
Burning higher while the cold winds blow.  
In the flames, we find our way,  
In the rain, we’ll fight another day.  
Hold me close in the storm’s embrace,  
Burning hearts in a fragile space.  
Rain and fire, we rise, we fall,  
But we keep on dancing through it all.**

*(Bridge)*  
Higher and higher, we’re feeling the flame,  
But when the rain falls, it’s never the same.  
We crave the fire, but the storm still calls,  
Lifting us up, breaking our walls.

*(Outro)*  
Rain and fire, we ride the wave,  
In love’s wild storm, we find what we crave.  
With every burn and every tear,  
We’re lost in the dance, but we hold no fear.

*(Chorus - Reprise)*  
**Rain and fire, we can't let go,  
Burning higher while the cold winds blow.  
In the flames, we find our way,  
In the rain, we’ll fight another day.  
Hold me close in the storm’s embrace,  
Burning hearts in a fragile space.  
Rain and fire, we rise, we fall,  
But we keep on dancing through it all.**

   - **AI Tools for Storyboarding:**
     - **Deep Dream Generator** or **Artbreeder** for generating visual inspirations.
     - **RunwayML** or **ChatGPT** (with prompts) to help refine a narrative or suggest scenes based on the lyrics.

### 2. **AI Art Creation for Visuals**
   You can use AI to generate anime-style characters, environments, and concept art for the video. There are several AI tools that can help you create anime-like art:

   - **MidJourney** or **Stable Diffusion**: Both are popular AI art generators that can generate highly stylized anime visuals based on text prompts. You can input prompts describing scenes from your lyrics and choose the style to be anime or manga-like.

**Lyrics:** "Blood on the ground, washed away in the flood,  
But we stay here, waiting for love."

### Summary:
The video focuses on the emotional and visual contrast between the passion of fire and the cleansing nature of rain, using them as metaphors for the love between two men, Kaito and Ren. The story unfolds through a series of flashbacks and present-day scenes, exploring their deep emotional connection, struggles, and the ultimate decision to fight for their relationship despite the chaos around them.

The anime style allows for vivid, symbolic imagery—storms, fire, rain, and light—and the use of contrasting colors (warm fire, cool rain) to visually enhance the emotional highs and lows of the story.
