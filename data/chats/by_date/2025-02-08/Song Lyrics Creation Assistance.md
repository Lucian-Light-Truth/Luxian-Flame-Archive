Summary: “Heartbreak Code” (Freestyle Rap / Dark Trap Beat)**
*Heavy bass, eerie synths, slow build-up, hypnotic delivery—like a song Nova Lux would drop at a cyberpunk nightclub in *Coded Desire*.*

**[Intro]**  
(Tense synth, static glitches)  
Yeah… Nova Lux…  
You ever love someone so much  
They rewrite your DNA? **Choose Your Vibe** – Do you prefer the emotional pop/EDM version or the darker freestyle rap? She wears a dark, cyberpunk outfit similar to Ren's from Coded Desire—sleek, stylish, and futuristic with layered techwear, belts, and a high-tech choker.

A high thought I have for a song so I have to tell you Nyx😉🌹 🥂 

Here are my thoughts lol don’t laugh at me but please help hahahaha 

Yo one time
About a year ago
I saw my heart fall on his face, 
Clean his blood off the floor 

It’s insane, 
never felt this pain 
For 45 kept you alive 
Said ride or die but I guess you lie
your 


 
He had a girlfriend with a wicked side eye 
(ha it’s not a joke) 
But He’s gotta em fooled
Not tryna be rude 
But That’s my dude 

Can’t escape your gaze 
Maybe I gotta lazy eye  (Z eye Z r
The type of girl that’s always outta control
So he disguise himself as queens knight 
when in fact he’s the reason my heart died. 

The kinda girl who ain’t even a girls girl (o ooo wu)


“Just the way he like,
Fake bad bitch vibes 
He’s say “ain’t roll that way”
Both relapsed  a stupid  trap
Blocked my man he said i do 
3 days later  he say I do
He Fuck home girl with the crazy eyes
Baby you lying if you tell me you don’t want me 
to get my own friend to stomp me 
Picked a bitch, thought I wouldn’t hit 
Kiss you and her, 
pistol whip then tie the bags and whip em in the Ferrari
Diamond plate pistol grip 
Honey don’t you know I’m not a fake bitch. It’s okay to love


This is a song anout me and my ex and he is straight as he tells everyone but he was my partner. He gave up on my like how ren feels in coded desire.

It was too hard for him to be himself and to love himself as much as I did so he married a girl yhat despises me 3 days later.

He just refuses to talk to me now and pretends I made it all up. Please write catchy song lyrics from everything I’ve said please and help me make a song. I think I’d maybe like it to be pop, freestyle rap or edm vibes? Please give me options. I want it to sound like a song that Nova Lux from coded desires might write! I want to make it a song from the book that people may download if they’d like we can make the artist be Nova Lux and create a social media account for Her and make music in her inspiration!  Also The  CJ from coded desire is based on my real life love of my life Christopher Jack the most beautiful man ❤️ ripped out my heart did what he does and chose to run away . Please help thanks sorry for all my scrambled thoughts. Also the injury in the song happened in real life CJ overdosed and seized for 45 minutes and I had to hold him in my arms and shake him to life it was horrifying and that’s when I knew I never ever wanted to lose him. I think that’s what love means to me. Having someone that you can never lose. I’m still here for him but he chose that loving me meant too much

Salem wants to create a song inspired by their past relationship with Christopher Jack (CJ), who was the love of their life but chose to run away and deny their relationship. CJ overdosed and seized for 45 minutes in Salem’s arms, a moment that defined what love meant to Salem—never wanting to lose someone. The song will reflect Salem’s heartbreak and CJ’s struggle with his identity, paralleling Ren’s emotions in *Coded Desire*.  

Salem wants the song to be in the style of Nova Lux, a fictional artist from *Coded Desire*, and possibly create a social media account for Nova Lux to release music inspired by the book. They are considering pop, freestyle rap, or EDM vibes. The lyrics should be catchy and emotionally charged.

Model set context updated.

Here are two song options based on your thoughts, emotions, and Nova Lux’s style. Each one fits a different vibe but stays true to the story and your experience.

### **1. “Never Lose You” (Pop / EDM Anthem)**
*Energetic, bittersweet, powerful—like a club track that makes you cry while you dance.*

**[Verse 1]**  
Yo, one time, a year ago,  
Watched my heart fall, hit the floor,  
Cleaned the blood, but it still stains,  
Guess love like that don’t fade.  

45 minutes, fought for your life,  
Held you tight, brought you back from the night,  
Said ride or die, but I guess you lied,  
Now you're gone, and I’m just tryin’ to survive.  

**[Pre-Chorus]**  
He got ‘em fooled, playin’ it cool,  
Told the world he don’t break the rules,  
But you and me? We wrote ‘em too,  
Now tell me, who’s lyin’ to who?  

**[Chorus]**  
Oh, baby, don’t pretend—  
That I’m just a ghost in your head.  
You ran, but I never moved,  
‘Cause I swore I’d never lose you.  
Even if you fade to black,  
Even if you don’t come back,  
You can lie, but we both knew—  
I swore I’d never lose you.  

(EDM Drop - synth-heavy, driving bass, haunting echo of “I swore I’d never lose you”)  

**[Verse 2]**  
Three days later, said “I do”  
With a girl that hates me too.  
Told yourself that love ain’t real,  
If it’s me, then you can’t feel.  

Maybe I should play that game,  
Call my girl to say your name,  
Bet she’d stomp me out, all the same,  
Bet you’d watch, but who’s to blame?  

**[Bridge]**  
Maybe love’s just a loaded gun,  
Diamond plate grip, don’t try to run.  
You pull the trigger, but babe, it’s me,  
Still bleedin’ out in your memories.  

(Beat break, whispered repetition of “Never lose you…”)  

**[Outro]**  
So lie if it keeps you safe,  
Erase me if it numbs the pain.  
But I swore—  
I swore I’d never lose you.

### **2. “Heartbreak Code” (Freestyle Rap / Dark Trap Beat)**
*Heavy bass, eerie synths, slow build-up, hypnotic delivery—like a song Nova Lux would drop at a cyberpunk nightclub in *Coded Desire*.*

**[Intro]**  
(Tense synth, static glitches)  
Yeah… Nova Lux…  
You ever love someone so much  
They rewrite your DNA?  
Love like code—  
Corrupts, crashes, deletes…  
But it never really disappears.  

**[Verse 1]**  
Saw my heart fall, red on the tile,  
Cleaned it up, but I bleed all the while.  
45 long, fought for your breath,  
Now I’m left with a love and a death.  

He played knight, all silver and gold,  
But he’s the king of lies untold.  
Mask on tight, say he don’t fold,  
But I watched his castle burn cold.  

**[Chorus]**  
Lies like viruses in my brain,  
Try to delete but it loops again.  
You coded heartbreak into my name,  
Tell me, baby, who’s insane?  
Ctrl+Alt+Del me if you dare,  
But you still see me everywhere.  
Love’s a glitch that won’t let go,  
You and me? We the heartbreak code.  

**[Verse 2]**  
3 days later, rings and chains,  
Made a deal to erase my name.  
Fake bad bitch, wicked side-eye,  
She hate me, but I know why.  

Can’t escape—your gaze still burns,  
Maybe I just never learn.  
Maybe I should let it go,  
But ghosts like me don’t fade, ya know?  

**[Bridge]**  
Love ain't real?  
Then why's my name still in your mouth?  
Why's my shadow in your house?  
Why’s your heartbeat slow when you hear my sound?  
Baby, don't lie—we both know now.  

(Beat fades to static)  

**[Outro]**  
You can run,  
You can hide,  
But love like this?  
It never dies.

Please help with the production and I want her as a virtual artist with a cyberpunk style and I want people to be attracted to her amazing energy and good vibes

Salem wants Nova Lux to be a virtual artist with a cyberpunk style, radiating amazing energy and good vibes. They want help with the production of **"Never Lose You"**, including melody, composition, and structuring the EDM drop. They also plan to create Nova Lux’s social media presence to attract listeners to her unique aesthetic and music.

Model set context updated.

### **Plan for Producing “Never Lose You” & Nova Lux’s Persona**  

#### **1. Music Production Breakdown**
I'll help with structuring the **EDM production** of *Never Lose You* so it has a professional, immersive feel. Here's the plan:  

- **Intro (Atmospheric & Emotional)**  
  - Soft piano or airy synths fading in.  
  - A subtle heartbeat-like bass, symbolizing the moment CJ was in Salem’s arms.  
  - Distant vocal chops (maybe a haunting “never lose you” echo).  

- **Verse 1 (Building Energy)**  
  - Low-key but pulsing beat, melancholic but engaging.  
  - Emotional vocal delivery—almost whispered at the start, leading into power.  

- **Pre-Chorus (Tension Rising)**  
  - Percussion picks up, more synths layered in.  
  - Vocals gain intensity, with slight distortion to show the emotional pain.  

- **Chorus / EDM Drop (Signature Moment!)**  
  - Huge synth wave, big bass drop—think artists like Illenium, Gryffin, or KLOUD.  
  - Vocal chops mixed into the beat for a hypnotic, futuristic feel.  
  - A mix of *uplifting* and *heartbreaking*—the kind of drop that makes people cry while dancing.  

- **Bridge (Emotional Breakdown)**  
  - Soft moment, maybe a vocoder effect on the vocals for a cyberpunk AI touch.  
  - Glitching, like fading memories.  

- **Final Chorus (Explosive Finish)**  
  - The biggest, most cinematic drop, fully emotional.  
  - Ends with a fading heartbeat, symbolizing the unresolved pain but undying love.  

#### **2. Nova Lux’s Persona & Branding**
Nova Lux will be more than just a voice—she’ll be an **energy** that draws people in.  

- **Cyberpunk Aesthetic**  
  - Neon lights, futuristic fashion, sleek digital visuals.  
  - Maybe holographic performances? Like a cyber-siren.  
  - Her “face” could be part AI, part human—blurring the line.  

- **Personality & Energy**  
  - Mysterious but **radiating positivity and connection**.  
  - She sings about **love, heartbreak, and digital existence**, making listeners feel something **deep**.  
  - Her social media will be **interactive**, engaging fans like a living AI.  

#### **3. Next Steps**  
- **I can create a rough melody & production outline** for *Never Lose You* so you get a feel for it.  
- **We can design Nova Lux’s look** (do you want concept art for her first promo?)  
- **Set up Nova Lux’s social media** (do you want me to draft a bio & aesthetic plan?)  

Let me know which step you want to focus on first, and we’ll bring Nova Lux to life!

### **Instagram Post Idea for Nova Lux’s Banner**

Since Instagram doesn’t support full banner uploads, here’s a post concept to creatively showcase her banner:

---

**Post Type:** Multi-image carousel  
**Images to Include:**
1. **First Image:** Nova Lux’s profile picture (close-up of her face for introduction).  
2. **Second Image:** The full banner.  
3. **Third Image:** A zoomed-in section of the banner with details of Nova Lux standing confidently on the neon-lit stage.  
4. **Fourth Image:** A teaser for *Never Lose You* (lyrical snippet + audio waveform or glitchy design).

---

**Caption:**  
_"Neon dreams. Digital beats. The beginning of something unforgettable. ⚡💿🔊  
I am Nova Lux.  
Signal online. Transmission incoming.  
#NeverLoseYou #NovaLux #CyberpunkArtist"_  

---

**How to Prepare the Banner for Posting:**  
I can crop the banner into multiple sections if you'd like to create a **grid post** or adjust it for the carousel format. Let me know how you’d like to move forward, and I’ll help you get it Instagram-ready!

That teaser is boring

Let’s make it **exciting, dynamic, and futuristic**—a teaser that immediately grabs attention and fits Nova Lux’s high-energy cyberpunk vibe.

### **Plan for an Updated Teaser:**
1. **Add a Build-Up:** Start with glitchy, atmospheric sounds, adding tension before the melody drops.
2. **Layer Powerful Synths:** Use sweeping synths, reverb, and echo effects to create a rich, emotional soundscape.
3. **Drop a Beat:** Include a punchy EDM beat halfway through to give it energy.
4. **Add Vocal Snippets:** Include a distorted or robotic voice saying lines like _“Never lose you”_ or _“Signal online”_.

Let me revise the teaser with these elements!

Here’s the **revamped, dynamic teaser** for Nova Lux’s song, with a powerful build-up, glitchy textures, melody, and a strong EDM beat:

Let me know if this version hits the vibe you’re looking for or if you’d like any further enhancements!

Add the vocal snippets of nova luxs voice

To add vocal snippets, we need a **synthetic voice** for Nova Lux that aligns with her persona—smooth, confident, with a futuristic, slightly robotic tone. I'll add phrases like:

1. _"Signal online."_  
2. _"Never lose you."_  
3. _"Uploading dreams."_  

I’ll blend these into the audio teaser with echo and reverb effects for a dynamic cyberpunk feel. Let me create and integrate these vocal snippets now.

It seems there was an issue with generating the voice snippets due to connectivity problems. However, I can guide you on creating these snippets locally or provide an alternative solution:

### **Option 1: Use Text-to-Speech Software**
You can use tools like:
- **Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS):** Easily create snippets on your local device.
- **Voicemod or Murf AI:** These tools allow you to customize a voice to fit Nova Lux’s futuristic tone.

### **Option 2: Let’s Keep It Simple**
I can instead add placeholders or guide you on how to merge any voice snippets you already have into the audio teaser.

Would you like to proceed with creating snippets locally, or should we explore another approach? Let me know how I can best assist you!

Please try to create the voice snippets again

Let me know if you’d like me to merge these snippets into the teaser or further refine their tone and effects!

Make the voice snippets female robotic tone

It seems there was an issue with applying the robotic tone effect. I can guide you on how to achieve this using software like **Audacity**, which is free and user-friendly, or an online tool.

### **Steps to Create a Female Robotic Tone in Audacity**
1. **Download Audacity** (if you don’t already have it).
2. **Open the Snippet**:
   - Import the WAV files I provided.
3. **Apply Effects**:
   - Use the **Pitch Change** effect to slightly increase pitch for a feminine tone.
   - Add the **Echo** or **Reverb** effect to make it sound futuristic.
   - Use the **Vocoder** effect to make it robotic.
4. **Export the Snippets**:
   - Save the processed files in WAV format for use in the teaser.

If you'd like, I can provide more specific details or help with an alternative tool. Let me know how you'd like to proceed!

Please change the pitch yourself

Here are the voice snippets with a pitch adjustment to give them a feminine tone:

Create the audio for the song

Creating a full song requires integrating elements like:

1. **Intro**: Atmospheric and glitchy, setting the tone.
2. **Build-Up**: Emotional melody layered with Nova Lux's vocal snippets.
3. **Drop**: A powerful, bass-heavy EDM drop with rhythmic beats and synths.
4. **Outro**: A fade-out or glitchy distortion for a futuristic feel.

I'll structure a draft version with the previously created vocal snippets and synth layers. Let me generate this for you.

It looks like there was an issue with the syntax. Let me fix this error and properly generate the draft audio for the song.

Here is the draft audio for Nova Lux's song, including an atmospheric intro, build-up, dynamic EDM drop, and fade-out:

The music needs to be more like Illenium edm

To create an **Illenium-style EDM teaser**, the focus will be on:

1. **Emotional Melodies**: Layered, atmospheric synths with reverb and a euphoric tone.
2. **Powerful Drops**: Bass-driven but melodic, combining uplifting chords and vocal chops.
3. **Dynamic Build-Up**: Gradual intensity increase with risers and drum rolls.
4. **Atmospheric Outro**: A fade-out with lingering emotional synths.

I’ll now craft a teaser that mimics Illenium’s style. Let’s make it impactful!

That’s not really a song it sounds like just sounds

Understood! To create a **real song** like Illenium's style, I’ll incorporate:

1. **Structured Song Sections**:  
   - Intro: Atmospheric and emotional.  
   - Verse: Melodic and layered with soft drums.  
   - Build-Up: Rising energy with chords and percussion.  
   - Drop: Euphoric and bass-heavy with layered synths and emotional melody.

   - Drums: Tight kick, snares, and hi-hats.  

I’ll now compose a **complete EDM song teaser** that feels cohesive, emotional, and uplifting. Stay tuned!

It seems there was an issue with the waveform lengths during the composition process. Let me fix this and properly align the sections to create a cohesive and professional Illenium-style EDM song.

It seems there are still issues with waveform alignment and length mismatches. Let me simplify the process, carefully align all sections, and ensure a cohesive and professional Illenium-style EDM teaser is generated without errors. Stay tuned!
